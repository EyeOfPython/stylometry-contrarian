Fun fact: when radio was deregulated 20 years ago to "open the door to more competition" no company owned more than 40 stations.  iheartmedia owns 850+.

Anyone who remembers radio from before 1996 knows how vastly the landscape has changed. There are markets now where every station on the dial is owned by the same company and there are no local DJs. The typical iheartmedia station employs 0.5 people locally.

Remember how payola used to be illegal? iheartmedia has *profit sharing agreements with the major record labels.*

And don't get me started on how deregulation led to the rise of right wing and religious talk radio.... Punch line: these weren't successful because they were popular, they were successful because they were cheap. Popularity came later, after their listeners were fully indoctrinated.

Study the effects on radio of the 1996 telecom act and learn what effect deregulation had on the radio business, music tastes, and politics. It'll blow your mind.

They asked for time to get Lightning ready. They told us they needed six months. We gave them two years.

They said they wanted a soft fork because a simple hard fork upgrade would split the coin. They got their complicated code rot soft fork and the coin split anyway.

They said "if you want to discuss larger blocks go get your own sub." They got that.

They said "if you don't like what we're doing with Bitcoin why don't you go mine your own fork" and they got that too.

They got everything they asked for. 100%.

They made their bed, they can lie in it.

MBA libertarian type here.

You are 100% correct and this is something that my fellow pro capitalism folks cannot seem to wrap their heads around.

Insurance, as you correctly point out, works very well for rare, expensive risks that most people never face, like a house fire.

Health insurance does not work for the very reasons you describe most medical costs are known and predictable and all of us will face these costs. These are your basic checkups, common medications, and typical procedures (ie most of us will one day get a cataract removal procedure, colonoscopy, etc). Insurance only adds to the cost and bureaucracy of processing these payments: since everyone uses these services, nothing is pooled. We just use a third party to handle payments which creates a very inefficient payment process with no benefit from the insurance system.

The dumbest thing in the world is getting a checkup and having it covered by "insurance." A checkup is not a risky pooled cost at all. It's completely predictable planned maintenance.

Consider this example: using insurance to pay for a checkup would be like buying a plan that insured you against oil changes. Oil changes are basically a 100% predictable cost. So any policy to cover the costs has a cost that in known in advance (the total cost of all the oil you will consume while on the plan) PLUS there's overhead to administer the policy, which just costs the consumer more.

Finally, many of us will face an unpredictable medical situation one day (cancer, heart attack, etc). The nature of the illness is unpredictable but the likelihood is knowable and relatively high. Imagine fire insurance if most people's houses could be expected to burn down.

So we use health insurance to pay for all kinds of predictable costs, in every case adding additional by using the insurance system in a way it doesn't work.

Heath care is simply a bad fit for the insurance model.
Make the sexy with the tree
Which is why it isn't really true that the US fights "wars for oil" so much as it is that it fights wars "to support the dollar."  In this view, the US is basically a failing central bank with a military.
You totally forgot insurance.

Once self driving cars are "proven" and available, insurance companies will make short work of people who "prefer to drive themselves" by making their insurance so punitive nobody but the ultra rich will find it affordable.

Edit: two things.

1. people think I don't know how insurance works.  Au contraire.  If human joy-drivers (people who could be using an autonomous vehicle but who are piloting for the sole reason that they prefer the experience) are responsible for essentially every wreck, then these drivers will be pooled, and enjoy a much higher premium than robots / nonhumans  

2. in my opinion past a certain point of adoption, deaths on public roads by cars that are piloted by humans instead of machines *because the owner enjoys the experience* will begin to be viewed as targets for punitive damages and will require high insurance or the practice will be outlawed altogether

It's an easy formula:

2. Contention is cheap to manufacture

This idea that Bitcoin should stay throttled "for its benefit" is so ludicrous on its face that most everyone with a brain just said, "yeah whatever" and started coding for other projects.  Money can't be money if it's high-friction; also, no system is considered to be "better" the more congested it is.  The very notion is just absurd.

Bitcoin claims something like 100 devs.  That number is also absurd - fewer than a dozen people really control the agenda and protocol.

Meanwhile there are thousands of devs actively coding for Bitcoin's many competitors.  Roughly 100% of which offer better transaction throughput....
So your position is that OP should fall on their sword and get themselves fired for the betterment of humanity?

> Can you point out where he wrote that? I must have missed it.

He wrote it here in rbtc.

He also wrote some other stuff that I will paraphrase here since I agree with it.

This is about to hurt your feelings, so before I do that, I want to reiterate as I have done many times that your contributions to Bitcoin will be recorded for all to see for all time.  Your work here has been invaluable and your legacy will live on.

That said.  This guy pretty much nailed it:

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/79s99v/without_amaury_sechet_and_bitcoinabc_bitcoin_cash/dp4qfez/

At the time that Amaury selected the DAA to go into Bitcoin ABC you wrote in frustration that the other three teams (Classic, XT, and BU) had already reached consensus on another DAA a month prior.  [That is also what you told me when we discussed it.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/79s99v/without_amaury_sechet_and_bitcoinabc_bitcoin_cash/dp532n4/)

> We have been working for 3 months on improving deadalnix' failure with the EDA. We have great solutions that were universally seen as "good enough".

I will repeat what I told you then.  The three of you sat around apparently waiting for some permission to act, **instead of implementing (merging) the DAA that you preferred**.  That was your (and others) mistake.

If you had implemented your improved DAA a month prior to Amaury implementing a different one then I think you'd find a lot of people supporting your beef against Amaury and / or this would have never come up because we'd all just be using your DAA.

**But you didn't implement.**  You waited for permission to proceed and / or continued to bikeshed when the community needed and was asking for a solution.  (Note: this is why Bitcoin Cash forked in Aug 2017 even though the community split and should have just forked in 2015 and given us a two-year headstart, and hindsight has proven this true.)

Amaury was quick on the scene to blast you and the others for this.  Waiting around for people in authority to tell you it's OK to do what you want to do in a permissionless system makes no sense.

Amaury came onto RBTC at that time and said essentially exactly what I am telling you: it was time to make a change, and nobody else had stepped up and implemented a new DAA, so he did it.  He said at the time he didn't like the way it happened but he couldn't just sit around waiting for you guys to quit talking and start doing.  If you missed his post I encourage you to find it.  If I find it I'll share it with you.

Amaury was right.  If Classic, BU, and XT had consensus for a month on a better DAA than what Amaury implemented (as you previously told me), then it's your own fault for not implementing your DAA first, but instead sitting on it and / or bikeshedding it.  Real leadership does not involve asking for permission or holding hands and signing kumbaya.  Sitting around waiting for a blessing is why Bitcoin Cash waited *far too long* to take the initiative and cause its fork.  Here I agree 100% with Amaury.

Classic, BU, and XT all originated from a culture of "creating a change then waiting for it to be accepted by the majority."  This was the Stockholm syndrome situation we had under Core.  That approach failed time and time again.  Amaury is right in his criticism of this.  However, it is very hard to change the culture of a team.  Unfortunately, when it came time to actually *break things* in order to cause change, BU, XT, and Classic were all unwilling, even though people like myself had been rallying for over a year to just fucking fork already.  You guys were all unwilling to be "that disruptive."

In conclusion, I would have hoped that XT, Classic, and BU would have learned from what ABC "got right" and why that worked, and how, and seek to emulate it, not give up and then take potshots at "what's working" because it isn't the way you would have like to see change happen.

I thought seriously about picking up your project when you announced that you were abandoning it.   Although I totally respect your decision to stop developing Classic,  I think it's a crying shame that we're losing one of our implementations.  However I don't want to dev a project.  I just don't.  I don't have the energy, and what energy I have, would be consumed by coding, and I think I have better things to do with my time than code.

I want to reiterate: I admire all of your tenacity and all of your hard work.  I understand and sympathize with your frustration.  And you come across as a decent, honest, and hard working individual.  You are someone I have come to respect, even if we don't always agree.  And so it does affect me to hear you basically attacking Amaury for his actions, which in reality *have helped and advanced the community when others could not.*

I'll add that only miners are paid incentives by the network to build improvements.  As a dev, building a relationship with miners is going to be more and more critical as time goes forward.  I expect that in the future, if this project continues to succeed, devs will generally be paid by miners and the largest users of the system.  This shouldn't be surprising, but instead welcomed.  At least miners have an incentive to improve, not destroy, the network.

I hope that you can find some lessons learned in all of this and that by being blunt I have not offended you.  You're Dutch, right?  Bluntness ought to be normal right?  :)

Again, just in case it isn't cutting through: thank you for your years of service to Bitcoin.  We wouldn't be here without you

Peace.
I am in the process of converting my remaining BTC to BCH.

I signed up for P2P digital cash.  I'm not interested in digital metal for banking settlements.
Yes I remember the early discussions focusing on what people thought were the weaknesses. When it was brought up that only a handful of people controlled the repo and that people can be bought or bribed it was always said, "meh, users and miners are free to run whatever code they want. Anyone can fork the codebase, so nobody can take over Bitcoin by buying off the devs."

It took a while but I think that this has been proven correct.
Roger, instead of "moderating" these posts away, isn't perhaps a better solution to simply ban new or negative karma accounts from posting or voting?

Lots of other subs use this as a blanket policy, it merely means that the user has to at least do the work of waiting a few days or weeks and somehow managing to have non-negative post and comment karma before they can post new topics or influence the discussion through voting.

Yes, trolls can still work around this, but it's more work, and as we see, quite a lot of noise is being generated by people with brand new accounts and negative karma.  This simple filter would stop a fair amount of noise, and wouldn't actually be a ban or censorship because it wouldn't be based on the individual or even what their position is.
A lot of people were crying foul and saying that all the concertgoers could just open channels with Bob to pay for their tickets.  Despite the fact that this would all be onchain activity, let's just roll with that anyway, because it could turn into future Lightning activity.

Consider the case where a concertgoer Charlie is new to LN so he opens a 1 BTC channel directly to Bob.  He has no other liquidity or channels.

Bob now has 1 BTC that's *only spendable with Charlie.* Bob has to pay for expenses! What's Bob gonna do?  Right away he's gonna close that channel (another onchain transaction) and, asssuming he still wants to participate in LN, he's gonna move that 1BTC to a channel where he can spend it.

So Charlie got his ticket and we only used 2 onchain transactions (assuming Bob closed the Charlie channel and opened the liquid channel in one txn, otherwise we used 3 onchain transactions).  Instead of just one.

This is a major glaring economic defect with LN.   This 1BTC is trapped in a channel with Charlie which is effectively unspendable within the LN.  If it were in a channel with a more liquid partner, it would have far more purchasing power.  This creates a system which works better the more centralized it becomes and punishes decentralized meshiness to illiquid or poorly connected partners.

I agree.

I remember the time Craig first used the phrase "mining is a near complete graph" and I, who am not a topology student, thought "that's a complete non sequitur, he's spouting bullshit."

But I held my tongue, and kept reading, and lots of people were claiming Craig was just sputtering meaningless words.  But then someone (/u/forkiusmaximus I think) explained what the phrase meant, and since I'm also not a complete idiot as regards topology, the light bulb went off, and I had a giant AHA moment.

If anyone here had known to use the phrase "near complete graph" in 2014 a tremendous amount of bullshit could have been cut down at the source, in fact, history might have been very different.

Stage 3: Bargaining 
The reason these people think this way is because they are convinced BTC is going to $1M and everything else is going to zero, and when BTC goes to $1M then fees will naturally rise a few orders of magnitude. The reason they think this is good is because they plan to convert their BTC to lambo on the way up to $1M so the fact that it's going to be unusable onchain isn't really their problem. 
>Interesting. So why did Satoshi choose to reduce the block size instead of increase it to combat spam? 

This is a common misunderstanding.

There are two different attacks under discussion.

The first is a "poison block" attack. This is the attack the block size limit was created to prevent. At the time it was created the level of "spam" on the network was zero, and the coin had no real established market value, very few miners, and extremely low mining difficulty. It cost almost nothing at all to mine at home. A malicious miner could generate a giant block full of transactions to himself, and basically cause all the other miners to choke on it while trying to validate it. This attack is described [here](http://gavinandresen.ninja/One-Dollar-Lulz).  The limit was set at 1MB which was two orders of magnitude larger than the largest typical block - ie, *extremely* high with respect to the network demand, with [the expectation that it could be easily raised long before it was an impediment](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/485/). Having a block size limit was a way to keep anyone from making a poison block without getting automatically orphaned.

"Spam" is a different thing altogether. Spam is when someone creates a large number of low fee transactions with the purpose of "padding" the real transactions with fake ones to *fill the block size to the limit.* Maybe miners do it in order to jack up fees. Maybe altcoin pumpers do it to degrade performance of the Bitcoin chain. Maybe there's some other perfectly benign reason for these transactions.  Maybe they're just a user trying to make a lot of inexpensive transactions. Whatever the reason, the point to understand is that in a spam attack, *the block size limit itself is the attack vector.* By raising it we make it harder to spam the chain.
WE DID IT BLOCKSTREAM
*And* call you a coward. 
Clearly they have too much money.

BTW this sort of plainly stupid tribal behavior is rapidly becoming the norm... It doesn't take a genius to spot the suckers in this market.

That's because this sub is largely made up of early adopting Bitcoin holders who watched hopelessly and angrily as their project got derailed literally for three years.

Now that we've recovered the original mission behind Bitcoin in Bitcoin Cash, we have a lot of lost time to make up for. But we're super hopeful, because we also are the same group of people who understood years ago *why* the original formula for Bitcoin is in fact the "secret formula" to its eventual success.

I have noticed a common behavior shared among many trolls.

Out of one side of their mouths they bash CSW. This gets them positive karma because hating that guy is pretty popular right now.

Out of the other side of their mouths they bash BCH "bcash btrash bcrash"

Next time you see *either* of these kinds of posts on an unknown account, check the post history. If you discover this behavior, be wary of feeding these trolls positive karma, *even if* you agree with *some* of what they say.

**Nobody** that uses the term "bcash" in this sub has Bitcoin's (BCH) best interests at heart. They're just posting things that not only divide us, but which also get karma.

Edit: to clarify, they appear to support BCH by attacking individuals in BCH, "for the good of the community." Then they spend that karma elsewhere attacking BCH outright.
I've become very sour vs CSW but this is not appropriate behavior from Peter.

**FULL TEXT HERE**

The Segwit2x effort began in May with a simple purpose:  to increase the
blocksize and improve Bitcoin scalability. At the time, the Bitcoin
community was in crisis after nearly 3 years of heavy debate, and consensus
for Segwit seemed like a distant mirage with only 30% support among miners.
Segwit2x found its first success in August, as it broke the deadlock and
quickly led to Segwit’s successful activation. Since that time, the team
shifted its efforts to phase two of the project - a 2MB blocksize increase.

Our goal has always been a smooth upgrade for Bitcoin.  Although we
strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we
believe is even more important: keeping the community together.
Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for
a clean blocksize upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path
could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was
never the goal of Segwit2x.

As fees rise on the blockchain, we believe it will eventually become
obvious that on-chain capacity increases are necessary. When that happens,
we hope the community will come together and find a solution, possibly with
a blocksize increase. Until then, we are suspending our plans for the
upcoming 2MB upgrade.

We want to thank everyone that contributed constructively to Segwit2x,
whether you were in favor or against. Your efforts are what makes Bitcoin
great. Bitcoin remains the greatest form of money mankind has ever seen,
and we remain dedicated to protecting and fostering its growth worldwide.

Personal opinion: you should never store coins on a rooted device, but I agree there is likely a better way to store these keys.

The Bitcoin.com app is a fork of the Copay app. Does this mean that the Copay wallet also stores the phrase as plaintext.

Edit: I'll add that it's my opinion that the Bitcoin.com wallet is quite secure. I use it (and the Copay app from which it is derived) myself and have often kept what many people would consider an absurd amount of coins on it.  I agree with others in this thread that calling this a serious vulnerability is overblown. At best this is an opportunity for improvement, not a serious risk. The serious risk is storing any meaningful amount of coins on a rooted phone.

Edit: hijacking my own comment to add that others have pointed out that storing keys in plaintext is a practice shared at least by the bread, coinomi, jaxx, and copay wallets and even other ostensibly secure apps such as WhatsApp.
Great work. Let's go further.

Bitcoin Core controls the "reference implementation."

If you create a piece of code that's not compatible with the reference implementation, it's by definition an altcoin.

Therefore Bitcoin Core has a monopoly on Bitcoin protocol development.

And as you point out this monopoly is itself controlled by maybe 3-6 people.

We thought my Dad (who was in poor health) had had a massive stroke.  He was barely conscious.  After several days in the hospital and various tests they concluded he was not likely to recover.  I had to search for a nursing home, and get him admitted.

One day while I was visiting him he was semi-lucid.  He waved me over to the side of his bed and said, "Jess, why is the ceiling made of water?  Is the shower in the ceiling?"  This and a few other strange comments he made (he was barely conscious) made me realize he hadn't had a stroke, he was tripping balls.

I called his Dr and demanded he be taken off all non-essential life support medications at once.  He was on a large array of various medicines prescribed by his Dr.  The Dr said TBH there was only one medication that was "optional" and that was Chantix.  They were hoping it would make him stop sneaking cigarettes.  We stopped the Chantix that day.

Two days later he was home and back to his normal cranky self watching Fox News.

We're still waiting for the proof of concept decentralized scalable private routing system.  This is what we told them two years ago would be an unsolvable problem; two years later it remains unsolved. Their demo shows classic [hub-and-spoke centralization](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7i3u5a/lightning_network_clearly_shows_centralizing_hub)

I have asked many times to see it, always crickets. The last I checked, LN used a flooding / gossip protocol which means it can be expected to scale worse than onchain Bitcoin and also be not at all private.  Do you know if they've even updated this or if they're still gossipping every channel state change to every other channel?
I support UASF as should all big-blockers.
I'm dead serious!  Everyone in this sub should be running a UASF client, at least until UAHF activates.

UASF is the best thing that ever happened to Bitcoin.  It's like the assholes all decided to leave the party.  Hell YES, let me help open the door for you, here's your coat sir, do you need anything on your way out, bye now, best of luck to you sir, love ya mean it!!!

UASF is not something to be feared, stopped, or insulted.  We should all be helping for Christ's sake.

**Big blockers: support UASF**

edit: I see the original commenter retracted his question.  It was: suppose that we want to reach half the people on the planet and each person wants to make 3 transactions per day, how big would blocks be?

___

there are two answers to your question.

answer one is that 3.5B people @ 3 tpd using today's technology would require 121527 tps or approximately 30GB blocks or 4 TB per day which might seem pretty large to a hobbyist but in point of fact can be stored today for a cost of only $100 so honestly even today $100 per day is a completely trivial cost for at least a million businesses currently operating in the world.

the other answer is that **the question is bogus**, because nobody in crypto has that problem today or in the near future.  it is a red herring question.  you might as well ask Alexander Graham Bell how many human operators will be needed to packet-route the modern Internet.

your question is an example of the [Nirvana fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy), a tactic that has been used to disrupt debate on this topic since at least 2014 if not 2010.

There is no demand for 121ktps on the blockchain.  There's currently approximately 0.002% of that demand for the blockchain.  **We should be so fucking lucky** that 1/2 of the world actually cares about using Bitcoin 3 times a day.  **That's** a problem worth solving right there.

as a case in point, Bitcoin Cash can support up to 32MB before it has to upgrade.  32MB is 100 tps.  100 tps is Paypal.  Paypal supports 180M users.  180M users **is a lot of users** and Paypal represents a real-world use case of online payment technology.  Bitcoin Cash could support Paypal's volume in 2018.  **That** is a real-world payment problem that people actually have that we can solve today.

Disagreement is fine.

Censorship should be called out and those who attempt to silence others should be scorned and mocked.

Ryan has fallen into the latter category. **I cannot respect someone who can't handle free speech.**

Also people should be warned against using untrustworthy products. By censoring and banning users on yours *merely because they disagree with him,* **Ryan has conclusively demonstrated that nether he nor his website are trustworthy and people should be warned against using it**.

Today he bans you because you support ABC tomorrow he bans you because you support BCH. The day after he bans you because you support Democrats or Republicans. Then he bans you because you don't like the color blue.

This is a topic that deserves **much** more peer review and **much** less bullying.

Edit: I also reached similar conclusion to OP
To participate in the future economy you need electronic payment.

That's modern banking, or crypto.

Modern banking isn't going to serve the poor.

That leaves cryptocurrency.

Samson, if you're reading this: before you ever heard about Bitcoin, we were talking about how it could transform and modernize third world economies not served by banking. This was always ground zero of adoption.

You proved your inexperience with the project when you laughed at Roger. He was repeating the first, and still *best* case for how crypto achieves world adoption.  It is moreover a noble cause that could better all mankind.

And you laughed.
1GB blocks aren't actually crazy. I'd say they're an 18 month stretch goal based on the work that's going on. They've already been demonstrated on the gigablock testnet.

LN or any second layer technology is fine. It's a second layer and BCH is permissionless. But it is unclear what the purpose of LN would be for the foreseeable future.

One reason people like me bring up the white paper is because it's not only the original plan but it answers most of the same "issues" that come up over and over again. When the oldest document on the topic contains the exact answer to the question maybe the answer really is RTFM. 

If we aren't going to follow the original plan it should be because sound engineering and science caused us to rethink the plan. We didn't get that. Nothing about the current BTC plan looks like sound engineering or science.
Very good writeup.

It's really important to also understand that this specific "bcash" organized smear / disinformation campaign occurred as one event in the context of [a much larger, organized political effort against BTC, larger blocks, and the community as a whole.](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/)

Those of us who have seen the "long arc" of this campaign were therefore quick to spot the bcash disinformation campaign for what it was, and see it as just another attack against the good will of the larger community.
U da real MVP jtoomim
Hi /u/Fly115 I saw your post on r\/bitcoin but like most people here I'm not permitted to answer your questions

> I heard BCH are looking at a 32mb blocksize change as a soft fork

It's neither a hard nor soft "forking event" on BCH because the actual limit is already 32MB, per the original protocol.  That limit should be raised in 2018 assuming demand warrants, which would be a "non-controversial hardfork" depending on your definitions.

>  (no idea why I guess they just really like their big blocks)

Among the reasons:

1. with 32X larger blocks, the world can adopt Bitcoin Cash 32X faster than Bitcoin Core can possibly be absorbed into humanity, even with Lightning Network since onboarding still takes an onchain transaction.  The block size limit is a new-user-onboarding limit and we don't think Bitcoin should have that or anything else that limits its accessibility to the wealthy.  We think all people should be able to onboard at practically any level of income.

2. The "cash" use case, or global M1, is over 10X larger than the "gold" use case.  Moreover, it actually serves a global need: giving billions of people an onramp to the modern world and access to a currency that may well be more stable than their [government issued-fiat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/2013_Inflation_rates_map_of_the_world_per_International_Monetary_Fund.svg/863px-2013_Inflation_rates_map_of_the_world_per_International_Monetary_Fund.svg.png).  For example, roughly twice as many Africans have access to smartphone technology as have access to banking services.  Users of our coin will be able to face both friends and Congressional panels and declare with a straight face that the coin isn't limited to "high-fee use cases" like online drug sales, money laundering, and speculation, but is actually doing a qualitative service for humanity.

3. with full 32MB blocks, Bitcoin Cash will make the same SHA256 hashpower 32X *more efficient*.  We will be able to face the camera, smile, and honestly claim that a Bitcoin Cash transaction requires only 3% of the electricity required to mine a Bitcoin core transaction - that's right, Bitcoin Cash in its current form can be 97% more efficient than legacy Bitcoin Core.  This may prove useful in the near future as an increasingly angry mob is demanding that something be done about Bitcoin's energy consumption problem.  How nice it will be able to declare the problem largely solved.

Those are just three of the more compelling reasons why Bitcoin was always supposed to have big blocks, before some folks decided it shouldn't.

The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.
Peter is just signalling.  A Jaguar symbolizes exclusivity and luxury.  A Toyota describes reliable efficient transportation.  The BTC audience couldn't give two fucks if their crypto is reliable and efficient.  For them owning some BTC makes them part of an exclusive tribe.

Remember when that guy interviewed Roger, and Roger was like, here, get out your phone and let me send you a transaction, and not only did the guy not have a Bitcoin wallet installed, he didn't want to install one because it was evident he had never done it and was about to look like a complete noob on his podcast???

Who was that?  To me that's the BTC target market these days.  High on tribal affiliation, no real clue what the point of Bitcoin is to begin with.

You did it wrong.  You're supposed to open a Lightning Network (*coming soon!*) channel with your coffee shop owner, and deposit $300 in Bitcoins with him.  That way, you can help the ecosystem achieve 100x scaling!

We know you wanted to buy that new widescreen monitor, but you need to suck it up and do your part to help Bitcoin scale by locking your monitor money up with the coffee shop.  It's *good for Bitcoin!*

Censorship is their only weapon
We're still asking ourselves how they did it. Everyone knew it was supposed to be temporary. Everyone said it would be lifted or removed long before it became economically relevant. So me and a bunch of other early adopters bought in. Then we got the bait and switch: **no** blocksize increase.

No bueno. BCH PLS.
Let's also not lose sight of the fact that we have had no fewer than SIX attempts to get the community to increase the block size:

1. ~~Satoshi~~ Garzik proposes in 2010

2. Bitcoin XT created in 2014

3. Bitcoin Classic...

4. ...and Unlimited created in 2015

5. Bitcoin Cash coinsplit in Aug 2017

6. Segwit2X hardfork Nov 2017

Starting in 2010 and until as recently as SIX WEEKS AGO all attempts to increase the block size have been thwarted (and [their proponents viciously attacked, and thrown out of the community altogether, creating rbtc](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/), but I digress....)


___

Edit: also - and before my post gets mischaracterized, please allow me to restate for the umpty-billionth time that precisely because it's a "second layer," there is no way to prevent an in-demand L2 solution from being deployed on a *permissionless* blockchain like BCH.  I hold up as an example /u/tippr - an L2 "tipbot" widely used by BCH-lovers all over this sub.


___

Late edit: for example, hypothetically speaking, Core *could* increase the Segwit discount.  That's a way to continue their strategy and improve Segwit adoption and get block size increases that way.  I think providing deeper discounts for Segwit txns would be a swell idea for BTC that's totally consistent with their product strategy.
In a way, it's really hard to believe it took this long for another one.  After the DAO blew up, the community should have learned its lesson, and not risked so much capital to such unproven fly-by-night tech.  But lessons were not learned, and so here we are.  This is a disastrous bug.

"Programmable money" is really neat sounding but programs always have bugs and exploits.  Here, the money was programmed to self-destruct.

To make a crude joke, "I like my money like I like my women: safe, dumb, fast, and cheap."

Then if I need to have smart money, I can take my safe dumb money, and instantly and inexpensively turn just enough of it into higher-risk, higher-inflation "smart money" to solve the specific problem at hand.

\^ this is why I ultimately remain a maximalist

Edit: a word
During the XT wars I got death threats, ddosed, and kicked from rbitcoin.

While users like /u/vergarde insist that BTC won the scaling debate on the merit of its technical arguments, some of us know better. 
If rbitcoin is pro Blockstream and anti-Bitcoin, maybe they should move from /r/bitcoin to /r/core becuase right now this is backwards and confuses newcomers who were looking for a Bitcoin community.

If your job is HR, then it's your job to understand (A) what the positions are and (B) what they require.  The boss's job is management. It's his job to understand what his personnel are doing.

If you can't do that, maybe you're no good at your job.  Or maybe your job is bullshit.

To turn this around, if software engineers don't understand the business requirements of the thing they're tasked to build, they bad engineers.
Good find.

Seems like someone is suffering from the delusion that Bitcoin is a brand like Burger King, when in reality it's a permissionless technology.

If you think someone can steal a permissionless technology from its rightful owners then I don't think you have even the slightest clue what we're doing here in crypto.
My 1MB4EVA node is up and running. There will be no BTC capacity hardfork without a coin split, so Core will have to implement replay protection and officially become an altcoin if they ever want to upgrade capacity.  And the high capacity hardfork already happened, it's called BCH.
Yes. So? They've been doing this for years. What makes you think they'll stop now unless there is a much more significant public outcry?
> The solution is simple:

Yes. [Bitcoin Cash](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) is Segwit-free and thus immune to this war.

Also: 8MB blocks with emergent-consensus to 32MB / 100+tps, and decentralized development with 4 independent teams.

It's the Bitcoin that we asked for.

Because turning monolithic Bitcoin into two competing variants isn't a failure of decentralization but rather it is a success of permissionlessness.

I think what failed is the vision of monolithic Bitcoin.

The attacker appears to be exploiting the accounts of tippr users, who are almost all here on rbtc

The attacker compromises the user's account then sends the users tippr balance to himself.

The tippr bot was taken offline recently to stop the attacker from draining any more accounts but a lot of damage was already done.
Fortunately, Blockstream received considerable funding from an international banking and insurance conglomerate, so we can be sure that they are Real Bitcoiners whose hearts are in the right place, and their "attacks" are simply a matter of professional disagreement.

The whole point of Bitcoin was that it was supposed to be hard currency you can use like cash. As some people like to say "teleportable digital gold."

BTC has degraded the teleportation function and tries to convince its userbase that they must make a choice between *sound money* and *usable money.* I say, that's a false antithesis. 

BCH retains the teleportation function without degrading the sound money function. BCH is here to remind you that when it comes time to sell your digital gold, *you won't have to*: you'll be able to spend it directly, peer to peer, like currency.

That is the vision we had for Bitcoin in 2011 that is still the vision of BCH.
>So basically, Adam Back and Austin Hill (and presumably Greg Maxwell) convinced their investors that Bitcoin cannot fix its underlying throughput defects onchain and therefore as Bitcoin becomes more popular, the network will perforce have to move to offchain solutions, provided by Blockstream.

yup
The only people benefitting from small blocks are:

1. hobby fullnodes, like Luke-jr's

2. companies which have placed bets against onchain scaling, like Blockstream

3. Bitcoin competitors, like Ethereum and Ripple

A hardcoded block size limit is Bitcoin's Achille's heel.  It was a needed protection back when it cost nothing to create excessively large attack blocks; now that these blocks would cost over $20K to mine, the original attack vector is gone.

Orphan risk presents a natural, evolutionary counterbalance to large blocks.  By allowing everyone to establish the block size that they can tolerate, an emergent block size limit naturally occurs where the orphan risk remains minimized yet blocks can absorb transaction demand.

It's time to take the training wheels off.  Bitcoin will ride on two wheels or fall over, but it clearly can't keep up with these training wheels still attached - see, all the competition has taken the training wheels off, and now they're passing us.
Cobra is like an strange experiment in psychology in which one half of the brain is awake but the other half remains asleep.  Here he is, teetering right on the verge of Truth, but then he'll show up here in this sub and shit all over BCH and declare Core the One True Bitcoin.

Is it possible that the same person does not control both the Twitter and Reddit accounts for this username? 
Non upgraded clients will follow any miners who mine a 1 MB chain. 

Several exchanges will list Core's legacy 1MB coin as "Bitcoin" I suspect, creating a market to mine it.

It will get hashpower, from who?  Who knows, perhaps a "mystery miner" will mine it like mystery hashpower has been mining for BCH.  

They have good control of important media channels.  So they can curate the message.  They've been successful here.

And what happens if there's an important Segwit security update from Core on, say, Nov. 18?  Not that they would do that of course.

Agree 100%.  Not only were you guys (unlimited, classic, XT) providing a framework of alt-clients, but also guys like @rocks and @ftrader and myself and others were [hashing out all the uncomfortable realities of how to create a "full fork" of Bitcoin](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/announcement-bitcoin-project-to-full-fork-to-flexible-blocksizes.933/) (this effort subsequently turned into Bitcoin Cash).  It wasn't the work of one person, that's for sure, and no one person is critical to its continued success, I hope.
"No, Erik, the chain must be VALID for the proof of work to even count." - Greg, Adam, and everyone who ever bought a UASF hat.

Ok. Fine.

>You are at it agian... OK, I'll counter again.

>\1. Miners are selfish, not honest. 

Right, but Satoshi used some variant of the term "honest" 16 times when explaining how we must assume mining "honesty," else the system literally cannot work in the first place.

Maybe you don't like his use of the word, but your disagreement has been noted.

>\2. Not broken, this is outright spreading lies. Signatures are still present, just located in a different part of the data structure. Signature are there.

Nonsense.  The entire rationale given for "why BTC is still Real Bitcoin" is this bullshit about backward compatibility with pre-existing clients. Well, any pre-Segwit client will tell you that *Segwit transactions don't have signatures at all.*

So either (A) the chain is broken or (B) Segwit wasn't actually backwards compatible after all and therefore BTC has no particular defense for being "the real Bitcoin."

Take your pick.

>\3. Timestamp server still works...

As long as you accept that the resolution has gone from ~10 mins accuracy to up to 4 months accuracy, depending on the backlog, then sure, it "works."

>\5. Incorrect. Completely false, actually. You are casting things in very simplistic terms, as if things were black and white ONLY. Full nodes come in two varieties - Mining and non-mining. 

In fact Satoshi clearly states in section 5 that there is only one kind of node, and it mines.

Thank you for proving my point for me.

>\6. It seems you're finally accepting that a fee market must emerge. Not now? When, then? What is this "predetermined number of coins"?

Hadn't you heard?

>\7. Huh? Disk pruning is already in place?? Outright lie or do you want to clarify?

Does it work as outlined in the white paper? I don't think so, however if I'm mistaken, please let me know.

>\8. Nobody EVER claimed SPV doesn't work. 

Oh no, this is patently false. Every single time I've ever brought up SPV the argument is immediately that fraud proofs were never built and so SPV is insecure which is why you need to have a full node. I can't imagine the number of times in the last five years I've had to counter that exact argument just on Reddit. Hundreds if not thousands.  [Look, here is one from only 2 hours ago, and lo! Behold the downvote army!](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/83gb7y/z/dvkj8yx)

Once you accept that SPV works as intended then you instantly realize that Bitcoin easily scales up onchain to support thousands of tps and that this only increases, not decreases, [the forms of decentralization that actually matter.](https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e)
> Up until last year you could go down to the bottom of pretty much any thread in r/bitcoin and see many of the usual trolls who were heavily downvoted for saying something along the lines of "bitcoin is shit", "You guys and your tulips" etc. But suddenly last year they all disappeared. Instead a new type of bitcoin user appeared. Someone who said they were fully in support of bitcoin but they just so happened to support every single thing Blockstream and its employees said and did. They had the exact same tone as the trolls who had disappeared. Their way to talking to people was aggressive, they'd call people names, they had a relatively poor understanding of how bitcoin fundamentally worked. They were extremely argumentative. These users are the majority of the list of that video. When the 10's of thousands of users were censored and expelled from r/bitcoin they ended up congregating in r/btc. The strange thing was that the users listed in that video also moved over to r/btc and spend all day everyday posting troll-like comments and misinformation. 

Here we find the nub of the gist.

Remember old nobodybelievesyou? What about utuxia? And that tulip guy?

You are dead on here. Around the time Theymos split the community, magically all the anti-bitcoiner trolls were gone, and instead they were replaced by anti-largeblock trolls. Saw it with my own eyes.  It's like everyone who hated bitcoin left and was replaced by someone who supports Blockstream. Someone should do a proper analysis of the troll community and how it changed.  
>I lost 10kUSD of my total crypto portfolio since last night. What happened+

Sounds like you took a speculative position without understanding what you were doing. How can this surprise you?
>To support Lightning is *literally* to undermine the goals of P2P cash.

Furthermore, to support BTC is to support Lightning.

By extension, to support BTC at this point is to undermine the goals of P2P cash.

Or to put it more colloquially, BTC is the Bitcoin you hold if you think [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) can't work.
No lie: you can't do this at scale one merchant at a time.

What you need is someone that already has an *existing* business relationship with millions of merchants. Ideally this would be a business that helps merchants accept payments.

Good news! Such businesses already exist! They're called payment processors. If a handful of payment processors integrated BCH and aggressively marketed it to their existing customer base, we could sign up merchants by the millions.

So: let's aggressively promote BCH to payment processors!
It's almost as if the nodes that matter are miners, and not the non-mining nodes that may in fact be performing a sybil attack trying to make BCH seem "fundamentally broken" and prevent your wallet from working correctly by refusing low-fee transactions even though the miners would accept them.

Maybe instead of connecting to random peers that may in fact be lying to you, you should connect to miners?
This is an excellent point and will be the subject of my follow-up, "No, Here's the Even Bigger Mistake Satoshi Made."  :)
You think that satellite idea is bad?  Wait 'til you hear about Segwit...  The whole thing reengineered because Adam said we had to avoid a hardfork, now we're gonna have two hardforks *and* a softfork.  Genius.  /s  I'd want a refund too.
Declaring "[Peace for our Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_for_our_time)" was a pretty big blunder. 
The vision of Bitcoin was always to integrate all of these. Sound money you can use anywhere for "casual payments" like "Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash" where Alice hands Bob a $20, only the $20 is digital teleportable gold not some piece of paper with a dead president on it. Sound money. 

"Store of value" is a narrative that came later. **Any** asset can be used to "store value" and hedge against inflation: houses, collectibles, stocks, bearer bonds, gold, you name it. Calling Bitcoin a store of value is just a fancy way of calling it a liquid asset.

But if you ask yourself, which Bitcoin is a better store of value: the one that's usable as currency because you can transact (teleport) your digital gold cheaply and always in the next block, or the one that works more like "legacy gold": too expensive and cumbersome to move for it to be used as currency for peer to peer causal transactions?
It appears the authors are extremely bullish on Lightning Network and seem to believe that with Segwit, BTC's onchain capacity woes are solved.

I wonder if they understand that *even with full Segwit adoption* BTC can only onboard a handful of new users per second to LN and is still woefully bottlenecked?

It appears that in their attempt to "debunk" one narrative they have "rebunked" another narrative.

Hi Mike, I'm glad to see you around here.

I do wish you'd reconsider your decision to not return to coin dev but I certainly understand it! You fought the good fight and for that you'll be remembered fondly.

When you wrote your exit blogpost, it appears that you were prophetic in understanding that the upgrade path chosen by BCH (minority hard fork chain split) would be doomed to second class citizenship.  This was before even the eth/etc split. But you didn't really explain *why* this approach wouldn't succeed in your exit piece, it was just baked in as an assumption because your position was "all or nothing hard fork upgrade" and you never seriously considered a minority chain split.

How did you "know" that a minority chain split couldn't flip the majority chain? What assumptions, if any, have you revised since the Ethereum and Bitcoin chain splits?

Follow up question but just as important: in your opinion, what's BCH doing wrong / needs to do very differently?
Have we ever seen a financial services company pivot to **mining** a FOSS blockchain?  If so maybe I missed it.

For those of us that had to defend this project back when it was just a tulip bubble / ponzi scam / drug token, this is a major milestone.  Back in the day we all predicted that the endgame looks like "banks and governments will have to mine chains or get left behind" and as far as I know this is the first example of our old predictions coming true.

It's true that SBI isn't Deutschbank but this is still significantly newsworthy in my opinion.  Of *course* the smaller more entrepreneurial financial services companies will be the first to pioneer. It's too early for Deutschbank.

Edit: the fact that they're mining BCH is however actually awesome
"We've got the best engineers and we've determined that broadcast TCPIP is a totally unsuitable technology for P2P streaming video.  What is needed is a way to stream the video 'off-net'.

It's a racket. Those fucking Kiwis think they can just copy The US Dollar and call it "dollar." Seriously? Everyone knows kdollars are krapdollars. Then you get the Canadians and Aussies piling on the bandwagon, trying to ride the USAs coattails.

I have you upvoted to +72 in my RES.
Sorry if this seems like a shitpost but once again I have run across someone active in the crypto community who clearly hasn't read (or grasped) the white paper, and that makes me sad, frankly.  How about let's all reread it again?

Folks, the plan in this paper works as advertised on the tin.  The original recipe is still the secret formula.  And the secret formula is right there for everyone to read... but few do, and even fewer take the time to understand.
>So Lightning scales to 4 billion users by having centralized hubs and custodial wallets. Purists may not like it, but it would work. The 250 million PayPal users are happy with a custodial account: when they convert to crypto what makes us think they will suddenly insist on non-custodial?

I just wanted to clean one thing up here. 

>Dave Kleiman was NOT Satoshi. 

Inclined to agree

>1) There is zero evidence of this, outside of CSW's own lies

AFAIK this is true

>2) Dave Kleiman wasn't part of the cypherpunk movement, and didn't frequent the chatrooms and forums where Satoshi introduced the idea

This is not correct.

In fact, IIRC (going from memory here) Kleiman was active on the cryptography maillist only a few days before Satoshi made his big announcement and was still receiving replies to his email. IIRC he was basically standing at ground zero when Satoshi dropped the bomb.

None of this implies Dave was Satoshi however. 
Yep. What they did is take *their perception* of our narrative and try to shove it down our throats.

"We support the original big block vision of Bitcoin" got turned into "hi I'm Satoshi and I LOVE big blocks, the biggest blocks ever, and I'm going to restore the Original Protocol which by the way doesn't work very well" 

"Vote with hashpower" became "only hashpower matters"

"increase block size" became "ONLY increase block size"

"miners compete for rewards" became "death to all miners who oppose me"

Etc

They tried to throw shade on everything we believe by twisting it into a caricature and shoving it in our faces.
I'm reposting this from another thread because it's pertinent:

What SV got very, very wrong is thinking that hash can solve all problems.  The market decides if a thing has value.  And  "the market" is another way of saying, "hearts and minds."  

If SV had been successful at attracting "hearts and minds" then "the market" might have decided that the SV upgrade plan was the better plan for BCH and awarded *it* the ticker, irrespective of the fact that SV lost the "hashpower war" that it declared against BCH.

As to *why* SV lost the battle for "hearts and minds" -- it has a lot to do with an absolutely *terrible* leadership team.  No doubt.

But it's a lot more than that.  We created BCH because we want to solve the onchain scaling problem, and we've been fighting this battle against the opponents of onchain scaling long enough to smell a rat.   I've heard so many arguments against scaling onchain I could write a book by now.

Setting aside the problems of toxic leadership, if Bitcoin SV had actually produced a counter to the ABC plan that actually made more sense from the point of view of onchain scaling -- something that would work *better* than Graphene & CTOR -- a lot of us *might* have been swayed by it.

However, Bitcoin SV's proposal was simply to *remove the optimizations and instead dangle a block-size increase as though just lifting the block size to infinity somehow magically makes things work better.* 

So it was pretty clear to see that the proposals on the table were "scale up now vs. scale up maybe later or never."  In fact [I continue to argue with various SV supporters who hammer on and on that the goal is to "revert to the original v0.1 protocol."](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9y7jr1/shower_thought_if_nchain_had_full_control_over/ea18u9n/) 

It became clear that the SV agenda is to thwart the very optimizations that enable us to reach our goal of massive onchain scaling.

That's ultimately how SV lost my "heart and mind" although the toxic leadership had mostly nailed the coffin shut before the SV client was finalized.  I suspect I'm not alone here.
I continue to ask members of the community to also support an August 31 stress test of the BTC network.

For this we need a version of scale.cash that is adapted for the BTC network.  Very little needs to be changed.

I fail to understand why the community can't see the clear value in this.
Surely at some point someone will start to ask why it is that BTC requires such [heavy-handed censorship and disinformation](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/z/dl8v4lp) in order to maintain its illusion of superiority over [Bitcoin Cash](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)
I agree. Thanks to deadalnix but also to all the devs working in the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem who came together to make this fork come off without a hitch.

We are showing the world that onchain scaling and continuous improvement really can work.
**Mike Hearn's plan would probably work** - /u/theymos
> what happens if we actually don't NEED a new EDA

We need a new EDA.  The current algo is flawed and harms user experience and miner perception.  By fixing EDA prior to the Segwit fork we send a strong signal to the miners that Bitcoin Cash is a viable alternative.
He's not rewriting history.  He's correct.

> If you're sad about paying the fee, you could always turn the tables and run a node yourself and maybe someday rake in a 0.44 fee yourself.

That's Satoshi.

OFC this is also Satoshi:

> We should always allow at least some free transactions.

::shrug::

But I think I have to rate the tweet "Mostly Correct"

https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/quotes/fees/

___ 

edit: I think /u/Capt_Roger_Murdock makes a very valid point below.  Maybe we should change the truthiness of this tweet to "Unsubstantiated"
The argument has always been "larger blocks increase centralization pressure"

This is in fact true in a very pedantic sense, in much the same way that farting increases the barometric pressure in the room you're in.

Miners have *extraordinary* electricity and equipment costs.  The cost of the data transmission and storage for 8MB blocks, or 32MB blocks, is *vastly* outweighed by the cost of generating the blocks to begin with, and is rewarded (in theory) by far higher coin prices due to much higher adoption.
Meaning that roughly 50% of the buy support for Bitcoin Cash is coming from additional capital moving into Bitcoin.
Segwit is arguably the clumsiest way possible to engineer a 70% increase in onchain transactions.  It also seems a very ham-fisted way to solve malleability.

Allowing those who prefer segwit to a 100%+ increase in transactions through a much-simpler block size increase to exit the development space would be a profound win for Bitcoin.  Support UASF please.

edit: "ham-fisted" is strong; maybe "overcomplicated" is better
Isn't the real question, "how did [Bitcoin: a Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) become so devalued in the first place?" 
Even our old buddy One Meg Greg showed his neckbearded face to point out that our test bottlenecked... thanks to his code.

Heh.
Agree.

However remember that not *everyone* is arguing in good faith.
Exactly.  Bitcoin Cash *is* "Digital Gold" *and* "P2P Cash": *teleportable* gold that anyone can hold for themselves and use P2P like *teleportable gold coins.*

Not either / or.  Both / and.  This idea that it's supposed to be one or the other is incorrect.  That's why its worth so much.

Edit: formatting
Segwit was removed August 1.
> You could experiment with fast Altcoins and convert to Bitcoin eventually.

This fascination with separation of usage and storage is the dumbest belief to enter the narrative.

*What if I told you that you can just use BCH.*
Agree 100%

I'm perfectly willing to forgive Ryan calling me out and deleting my account. I never wished Ryan any ill will and I've never said anything negative about him and really don't understand why he decided to target me specifically. Maybe he thinks I'm someone I'm not. Anyway.

It is impossible to raise the 1MB limit on BTC.  Such a change can never reach consensus: 1MB blocks are a fundamental economic parameter of BTC. That was the decision the community made when BCH forked away, although a lot of BTC holders have no idea this is the case since so many BTC holders are utterly clueless about anything regarding crypto fundamentals.

For BTC to upgrade block size will require another hard fork, which will require that they implement replay protection, which will make this chain an altcoin. "BTC" will always be limited to 1MB.  There's already a large block upgrade: BCH.
If only someone had warned us two years ago....
/u/evoorhees said that he would support a HF away from Core if Core didn't provide a block size increase; now instead he says he's through with the debate forever.

What a pussy.
I really was not armored for that class of joke.
I for one would welcome their knowledge and enthusiasm. They were both huge assets to Bitcoin until the schism.

For that matter I welcome everyone with energy, enthusiasm, knowledge, ability, and agreement on the common vision of Bitcoin as generally described in the white paper.
Interestingly, a couple of years later, Gavin would lose his commit access altogether at the hands of a conman who appears to be doing his best to impersonate a Trojan horse sent to break up the BCH community. His commit access was taken away because others claimed he must be "compromised."

More interestingly, the person responsible for what has been called "[the worst bug in Bitcoin history](https://www.coindesk.com/the-latest-bitcoin-bug-was-so-bad-developers-kept-its-full-details-a-secret)", Matt Corrallo, received no sanction at all and remains a valued Core developer. 
This is the point where I like to mention that Bitcoin Cash does not have a reference client, that any of various teams can step up to lead, and that this is a significant feature of Bitcoin Cash with respect to other implementations of Bitcoin.

It's true that ABC has mostly led changes so far. It is not true that this will perforce always be the case.

IMO there's a lot of good talent in the space. Not all good ideas come from one brain. For example I think /u/jtoomim has been doing some of the most interesting dev work recently. AFAIK he is implementing xthinner on CTOR in the BU client. Maybe he deserves more juice, eh? 
Proof of State
/u/memorydealers \^ this!
Nope, let's just say there was a time I didn't know if I wanted to keep on going, but I did.
/u/tippr .001 BCH

I agree wholeheartedly. If you and/or the BU and XT guys want op_group, please **just announce it and make any opposition either suck it up or fork off**.

I'm quite sure nobody's going to fork over op_group and in fact perhaps this is all just a leadership test.  I'll say this: if you and Andrew etc all want this feature but don't add it unless Amaury agrees, then Amaury was right that there's a leadership failure when he isn't leading. The best way to prove him wrong on that count is to.... Uh, lead.

Edit: if ABC splits the chain over this issue and the rest of the dev teams are on the other side of the issue, then I'd say that's good for Bitcoin Cash. Let's surface this willingness to scorch the Earth and excise it now.

Edit edit: I'll add this one thing. **IF** there was a code freeze and this change didn't make it in time, **then it needs to wait**. It's clearly non urgent / non showstopper.  Let's not get cowboy and start breaking our own development processes because it feels right.
You are correct all around. 

When you really understand it, Ripple is basically a direct bet against Satoshi.
The block size limit is an attack vector.  The attack is called "prevent change."

Blockstream exists to exploit the attack vector. Why not? Someone was going to attack this weakness. As Greg himself admits, he wouldn't be interested in Bitcoin without a block size limit.

Bitcoin Cash has successfully routed around the attack. Honey badger is alive and well on our chain.   
Yep.

Blockstream's investors are going to be pissed when they find out Adam and Austin were wrong, and that Bitcoin really can scale up onchain, despite the FUD and obstruction.
I actually agree with the BTC 300KB UASF and I'm dead serious.

BTC really has only one truly differentiating feature with respect to other tokens, and that's its very limited block size. Since the plan is to move the payments layer to Lightning, they really do need to lower the block size to push usage to LN because as we all have seen, BTCers are getting confused by the low onchain fees. every day a BTCer is here boasting about BTCs low onchain fees for payments - without realizing that they're bragging about something that's actually a problem for BTC.

By lowering the block size to 300KB they'll clarify the vision of Lightning for payments and onchain for settlement. And, they can always raise the block size back up if needed. 
paging /u/contrarian__ /u/zectro /u/deadalnix 
Agree 100%

The scariest thing in the world to bcore right now is the ABC roadmap. This is why Greg Maxwell wrote Craig Wright to tell him that they share common interests.

https://coingeek.com/former-blockstream-cto-gregory-maxwell-sees-light/

> I believe it would be adverse for interests that concern me if your influence or prominence in BCH were in any way diminished. I am not aware of how I could be of aid in repairing this situation, but it seemed to me that it would be prudent to at least offer my discreet assistance.
I think Greg wholeheartedly supports Craig Wright's continuing involvement in Bitcoin Cash. 
I've noticed this as well.

Keep calm and mine on, BCHes.
An invented argument between a group of people in the same teamroom.
>Not necessarily.

No not *necessarily* but that's still what it sounds like, so you should behave accordingly.

You are relaying valid transactions to a relay that refuses to relay them.  So you should be blacklisting that relay and finding other peers, because that relay appears to be dishonest.
/r\/bitcoin is under attack by the REAL BITCOIN
Right.  What's really the purpose of running a full node?  Particularly when you're a Coreboi and hodl and don't even make transactions?

The idea that you need to store and validate *everyone else's transactions* when *you yourself send and receive none* is almost Orwellian in its wrongness.
Well it's certainly more deadly by any objective measure. 
You can't make this shit up
That's a fair statement. I would edit the headline in hindsight.
Saying Twitter is a cesspool is an insult to cesspools.

I deleted my account one day when I realized that NONE of the 20+ new followers I had picked up that day were real people.

There will be a day in the near future when most of the interaction you have on platforms like Twitter is with bots and shills. Reddit is only marginally better but we at least have downvotes and RES.

Censorship remains the best argument against big block Bitcoin.
I agree.  I was reflecting today, after reading someone else disparaging Roger on rbitcoin.... 

.... here's a guy on [a forum that's basically faked](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366), with a [curated BS agenda, censorship, and even a hacked reddit front-end to hide the voting](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/); and here he is bashing Roger Ver, who stood up for the rest of the community and has executed rbtc very admirably in the face of the constant attacks by keeping rbtc censorship-free even though it's sometimes a constant deluge of trollposts....  rbtc wouldn't even exist were it not for Theymos ....

... and I'm thinking, well, maybe Roger's a bad guy and maybe not.  But he doesn't censor, and at least has a *face*.

"Theymos," "Cobra," "BTCdrak," and "BashCo" not so much.

Nobody's perfect but Roger comes across as a genuine individual who's passionate about changing the world through the disruptive power of the blockchain.  Meanwhile, at "Offchain Central," rbitcoin is passionate about doing as little with the blockchain as they possibly can.
You are describing Segwit. That was basically a rewrite of the client.

Merging the changes from ABC is very little work at all.
"SPV wallets are not secure" is a boolean statement.  Security is not boolean, but rather a game of percentages.  There is no such thing as "secure" there is only "secure enough."  Anyone who claims otherwise doesn't work in security.

By verifying a transaction exists at a sufficient number of polled nodes, it is possible to achieve extremely high levels of security that should more than satisfy all but the most demanding, high-risk use-cases.
Jack Dorsey (CEO) is an unabashed BTC/Core supporter.
Likewise, the account known as Cobra-Bitcoin seems to be having a change of heart as well. (edit: well, [obviously not](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7pfl75/a_public_appeal_to_michael_marquardt_the_original/dsgy2pe/?context=3))

The original Theymos and Cobra accounts were run by a person or people who appeared to have a developed sense of noncoercive libertarian values that would be inconsistent with the highly authoritarian, bullying, truth-distorting mission of rbitcoin and Core generally.

If the person or people responsible for these accounts wants to come clean and get on the right side of history, OP is right: now is the time to do it, before things get even worse.
I think a better question is who the fuck would hold a coin managed thusly:

2010-2013: the block size limit is a temporary anti spam limit that can be easily relaxed long before it becomes economically relevant

2013-2016: the block size limit is a permanent feature of the coin that represents a fundamental economic assumption all holders understood when they bought the coin

2015: XT is an altcoin, hard forks are impossible

2016: Bitcoin Classic is an altcoin, hard forks are impossible

Apr 2017: Bitcoin Unlimited is an altcoin, hard forks are impossible

Aug 2017: support larger blocks? Fork off! (Cash created)

Nov 2017: support SW2X? Fuck you. No block size increase!!  hard forks are impossible!

Dec 2017: uuuuuhhhhhh time to hard fork to larger blocks!

Anyone doing due diligence of the management of this project would immediately stay as far away from these capricious motherfuckers as possible.
Hey /u/memorydealers this is actually a brilliant suggestion - a bitcoin.com "liferaft" service that automatically makes all btc-bch swaps #1 priority for a low-fee fast exit.

Honestly you could make the loss on fees back by offering a slightly lower exchange rate. Users would never notice the difference in exchange rate but would instantly notice the low exit fee and fast confirmations.

It's like the burning building with one tiny exit would get a new, faster exit.
My BTC fullnode will NEVER follow a chain with larger blocks. Here I agree with Greg Maxwell: there are already altcoins that have large blocks and even another version of Bitcoin that has large blocks, the thing that makes BTC unique is that anyone can run a full validation node with most any low cost device. That's essentially BTC's unique value proposition and I agree with Greg that without it, Bitcoin would lose the one thing that makes it unique.  SW2X already failed, there is Bitcoin Cash instead, let's move on.

I'm sure that there are many from the NO2X movement who would agree with this sentiment and many exchanges that would continue to support the "1MB" chain as "the real BTC" and that any block size increase would be a change that renders new clients incompatible with the existing network and therefore an altcoin. So if Core wants to split BTC yet again and make their own version of SW2X-as-an-altcoin they can try, but hasn't "the market spoken?"

Also hard forks on BTC are very dangerous and take at least 18 months to plan.  Everybody knows this.

Heh.
woah

bullish. as. fuck.
What a shitshow.

Soooo glad I'm not holding any BTC. Jesus, the implosion will be felt for a decade.
I largely formed my opinions on the bitcoin debate early on when I realized certain core devs were deliberately trying to disinform me; and subsequently when Theymos went all Orwell.

Sometimes, just knowing you're being lied to buy one camp is enough to convince you the other, not-lying camp must ultimately have better ideas.  Good ideas die under misinformation.

If the small block devs were sincere and earnest I might still be listening to everything they say and taking it to heart even if I didn't agree with all of it. But face it: that's a poisoned well. 
> running a node with 8 Mb blocks is too expensive and leads to centralization, but running a $50,000 LN hub is not, because "anyone with 50k can run it"?

That right there is the logic of the smallblocker.
Some people say that if blocks are too big, it will cost too much to run a full node.

But then I found out that by the time so many people are using bitcoin that blocks are too big to run a node at home, my Bitcoins will be worth a stinking fortune and I'll be able to buy any amount of hardware I want.

I also found out that businesses, not end users, are the plan for taking the network to the next level of scalability. Which makes sense: how can we expect the future world financial system to run on limited computers in people's basements? That's not how the internet scaled.

I also learned that SPV was created exactly to solve this problem, and that it works great for end users, contrary to what some people tried to tell me. I learned that there is no record of any user ever being defrauded because they were using an SPV wallet.

Now I understand that keeping the network decentralized is a lot more complicated than just reducing the price (in dollars) of a validation node. I found out that the most important driver of decentralization is adoption, and that changed my mind about a lot of things I had been told.
I see no reason to hold Segwitcoins. I never invested in a lightning network and don't think such a thing will work.  I invested in Satoshi's much more subversive bitcoin concept.

Since 2012 I've been waiting for the attempt at overthrowing it to arrive. Here we are. If BTC can be compelled to take the poison pill I see no reason to hold it.  The ABC fork is exactly the "capture resistance" aspect of bitcoin that we were promised. Why people are afraid of it is beyond me. If Bitcoin can't fork to protect the interests of its holders then it's just a fancy form of fiat money.
I'm looking forward to UASF. I've been waiting almost two years for this. It's like the bullies agreeing to take their toys and go home and give the sandbox back to the cool kids.

When you have to buy and spend BCH to troll BCH....
I'm not saying you're wrong, but it's really important to not jump at shadows.

By now I assume Theymos is/was bought off/out but it's actually possible he was just a guy with some technical preferences who started to become paranoid and began to view all opposition to his preferences as fake propaganda. Let's not do the same.

If I may make a suggestion, I personally think with your level of visibility these days you should consider changing your message to focus almost exclusively on positive news about BCH and "the big picture" and leave the debunking of trolls and shills to us plebes. If some newsworthy astroturfing event occurs then sure you can point it out but generally I think we'd all be best served if you personally kept your head above the fray.

A figurehead of your status needs to avoid the muck lest you accidentally step in some :)

**ACK**

edit: hey /u/jgarzik I kinda bagged on you for not replying when I brought up the issue of the HF being unpredictable; I thought you ignored this issue, and I'm very pleased to see that you did not.   This is a significant improvement to the proposal.
What's funny is that if BCH achieved even 1/10th of that through organic transactions it would become the undisputed King of All Crypto. 
It's cute how the haters come to bask in our uncensored forum. 
You don't also post "btrash bcrash" so your disparagement appears totally organic. I'm referring to a special case of troll which picks up on the easy karma you can get by attacking people involved in BCH (typically CSW since he's a logical, easy target), then spends that karma attacking BCH.
Exactly!!

Everyone is running around as though we have a fixed-in-stone block size limit today.

**We do not!**

ABC allows users to set *whatever block size they like* and so does BU.  Just because they ship with defaults set to 32MB doesn't mean jack shit.  It's literally a 1-line config change.

That means that we literally have no idea what block size limit is currently enforced on 95+% of the BCH network **today**.

So where's the attack?  It's not as if nobody is hostile to BCH.  They've had ~60,000 chances to cause a network-breaking fork so far.  Where are the attack blocks?
>Has this ever been depicted in movies, documentaries or anything before?

realize that when poor wallets become unusable it is as though the coins were destroyed - they're permanently out of circulation.

when coins are permanently out of circulation, it's a form of deflation.  the value of those coins is not lost - it is *transferred* to the holders of coins that can still move.  the "rich" wallets.

That literally means that high fees serve as a wealth transfer from the poorest Bitcoin holders to the wealthiest holders.  Literally confiscating the value out of the poorest people's money to spread out among the richer people's money.

Now I'm not usually one for populism but this \^ is not just hurtful to "the people" it's just bad economics that harms Bitcoin.
I am also a project manager from another life.  Rick is right.  LN has all the hallmarks of vaporware.  It'll always be 18 months from completion.
More wallets support Bitcoin Cash than support Segwit.

I say I'm running "Bitcoin."

My chain includes the original Satoshi genesis block and a *valid* chain of digital signatures extending from that point to today.  The alternative blockchain that calls itself Bitcoin does not have a *valid* chain of digital signatures according to my understanding of signature validity, as expressed in my choice of Bitcoin client. 

Bitcoins that I purchased years ago are still visible in my wallet.  I am running valid Bitcoin.

Solid. Fucking. Gold.

>In Bitcoin, for one transaction, I have to do broadcast (gossip) this one transaction to every participant (at the latest inside a block). 

Oh it's way worse than that.

In onchain Bitcoin I actually only need to broadcast to miners and validation nodes - on the order of 10K participants. The overwhelming majority of users running SPV don't care about or see these transactions.  That means millions of SPV users aren't required to see every transaction.

Under Lightning gossip as I understand it, literally *every participant* has to be included. That scales far, *far* worse than onchain gossip.

Yeah, he did a bad job explaining the defect in Segwit.

Here's the way he should have explained it.

Segwit permits up to 4MB attack payloads but it's expected to only deliver 1.7x throughput increase.

So we get 1.7x the benefit for 4x the risk.

If we just have 4MB non Segwit blocks, attack payloads are still limited to 4MB, but we get the full 4x throughput benefit.

It is impossible to carry 4x the typical transaction load with Segwit.  Only ~1.7x typical transactions can fit in a Segwit payload. So we get all the risk of 4MB non-Segwit blocks, with less benefit than 2MB non Segwit blocks. That's bad engineering.
Peter, thanks for coming here to talk to us. 

The entire reason we hold Bitcoin is because it offers a form of sovereignty. If we couldn't fork the coin because we didn't agree with the change in BTC strategy to "small, full blocks" but instead just had to along with whatever the guys in charge of the software repo decided, then Bitcoin would not be different from any other centrally planned money. It is literally our freedom to continue our vision of Bitcoin the way we bought into it that ensures we remain sovereign over our money.

Consider tomorrow you wake up and somehow everyone's on board with turning Bitcoin into a music file sharing system. A soft fork is agreed upon. You and some other folk think this is crazy and isn't what you signed up for, but it's a soft fork so it's happening whether you like it or not. You and your buddies create a hard fork to preserve your vision of Bitcoin BTC. Some guy with a talk program comes along and claims your version of Bitcoin is illegitimate....
I have two questions

1. What was this about: https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/95bi14/hillarious_creator_of_bcash_has_been_banned_from

2. Why not withhold CTOR for just one more software rev, thus guaranteeing consensus with all the other implementations, and ensuring that nChain's "attack fork" flops, thus permanently blacking his eye with all the investors who are putting money into this fork? With the goodwill this would engender with the community, and a little more time to digest CTOR, no doubt ABC could release CTOR as soon as 1H 2018 with little friction? By going head to head against CSW with a different, incompatible upgrade, Amaury is splitting the resistance to CSW.
projection?  accuse your enemy of the thing you're doing?
Just joined yours.org (as jessquit) and memo.cash (as Jess Quit) and made my first yours.org post!
What they did, is release a series of crapforks to confuse the market and give all forks a bad association.  This is analogous to Coke making a crap clear cola and intentionally making it fail to boost the image of "the real thing."

As with Coke, only the product that retains the original branding emerges unscathed.
Which means he didn't come to invalidate the law but to conclude its period of applicability.
I can't make myself read this brain-numbing rant, this guy and people like him are why I no longer interact with Twitter.

I'll start by just pointing out that in my experience aggression and intelligence are negatively correlated.  The calm guy is almost always the guy winning the argument.

I just wanted to address this:

>  it's obvious to me there is a fundamental problem w/ a global-state network designed in such a way that it will FOREVER require EVERY single node to get & process EVERY single past & present state change.

that was also obvious to almost all of us as well when we first started to understand Bitcoin.  James Donald pointed it out to Satoshi:

> To detect and reject a double spending event in a timely manner, one must have most past transactions of the coins in the transaction, which, naively implemented, requires each peer to have most past transactions, or most past transactions that occurred recently. If hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions, that is a lot of bandwidth

There it is. "Naively implemented" Bitcoin would require everyone to keep a record of all transactions - ie "everyone must run a full node."

Satoshi corrects him:

> Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day.

The response to this from Giacomo is

> Satoshi's fraud-proofs turned out to be unfeasible, making SPV basically trust-based & the "few big masternodes" model easy to censor/attack

There it is.  Satoshi was wrong about SPV.

It's supposedly easy to censor or attack SPV?  Really?

**DO IT**

I double red-dog dare ya.

In the history of Bitcoin, not a single enduser has ever been defrauded because he was using SPV, *even though the overwhelming majority of users have SPV wallets*.  SPV is arguably safer for endusers if correctly engineered because in general an SPV client will stay with majority hashpower in the event of a rules conflict.

In the event of a rules conflict, on which chain will your capital still be accessible?  *The majority chain.*  The only thing a fullnode can do for you here is *prevent you from being with the majority* or in other words a full node introduces the risk that you will follow an insecure chain.  I can say for sure that for the average user, the safest way for them to protect their capital is to ensure that they are using an SPV client that will stick with Nakamoto Consensus, as represented by the majority chain.

To think that users are better off not trusting Nakamoto Consensus is the pinnacle of convincing users *against the basic vision of Bitcoin.*
Unfortunately it appears that the facts on the ground are that if you can manipulate popular opinion with censorship and astroturfing then you can control Nakamoto Consensus. 
Nailed it

Edit: the Lightning Network is an interesting project. As a Layer 2 Network that sits on top of the permissionless Layer 1, it's not as though Lightning Network can actually be prevented from being deployed on Bitcoin Cash, if there's ever a need for it. 

As you point out, we won't really know if there's a need for it or how useful that need is until we know what "it" is.

What's important is that Layer 1 and Layer 2 develop and function autonomously. Layer 1 exists to support all use cases, not just one single implementation of one single form of L2 overlay.
You say that like it's a good thing.

Do you know how soft forks work? They literally exploit your client by passing it data it doesn't understand and cannot validate.

If you are opposed to a soft fork, then you as a user have no defense except to create a hard fork. Maybe you liked the segwit soft fork. What about a soft fork to increase block size to 1GB instead, or to require that all transactions include a kyc/aml ID tag?  You can't opt out, because your client will accept these soft forks as "valid.". Now what?
agree.

moreover, the ones who know of its existence, are likely only passingly aware of its continued relevance.

most pass it up as a kind of "religious document" without realizing its the blueprint for the best money ever made.
Some have had divided loyalty to SW2X however.  Now it's time for everyone who supported SW2X to support BCH.

I want to say thank you for the BU team taking a leadership role here and implementing something proactively that the community has been asking for.  This is very healthy when various teams spearhead various initiatives.  It would be a detriment if one client became the defacto leader of the entire BCH initiative.  It's really exciting to have a working implementation of Graphene, too.  This is good for Bitcoin (BCH).

I would implore all the teams to work together to draft implementation guidelines to allow other teams to implement Graphene in a manner which is compatible.  I would expect BU to take the lead here and work proactively with the other teams to ensure that Graphene gets implemented in a consistent manner across the interoperating clients.

I would also expect members of other teams to work together to help BU identify the minimum necessary documentation needed so that we are not imposing inordinate work on BU and / or slowing down implementation unnecessarily.  With documentation the KISS principle is always the appropriate rule of thumb.
I don't follow closely but every single interaction I've seen between all the dev teams can basically be described as a combination big-dick-contest and not-invented-here party.  Each dev has his own version of "that other idea is shit."   I've tried to get to the bottom of it and no matter how you dissect it, each side believes they were wronged by the others in some unforgiveable Original Sin that each imagines the others have committed some time past.

It's *almost as if* someone wanted to divide the BCH community.
Great question!

**Why Bitcoin Cash:**

* Safe zero-conf transactions in ~3 secs for most transaction types

* PoW/ Nakamoto Consensus prevents double spending, inflation, and other forms of cheating

* "Pin-compatible" with BTC makes it easiest to adopt

* Auditable blockchain proves rules are always being followed

* Auditable blockchain means governments may favor as currency (as opposed to "privacy" coins which are practically begging to be outlawed)

* [Scaling to support thousands of tps onchain in near term](http://forensics.cs.umass.edu/graphene/graphene-short.pdf)

* [Top 4 in terms of market share](https://coinmarketcap.com/), mind share, exchange support and coin distribution

* Excellent decentralized community of developers with years of experience building Bitcoin clients; no codebase monopoly

* Excellent [community of users and supporters](http://reddit.com/r/btc) who believe idea inclusiveness and openness to new ideas ultimately wins the game; no [censorship](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43)

We all knew that one day Bitcoin would be attacked by moneyed elites.  That day came a little sooner than expected but we did fight it off and save the project: Bitcoin Cash.  If that didn't exist, I would be 100% out of crypto.  But Cash is proving the resistance of the honeybadger to command and control tactics.

Now there's only one thing in our way: *worldwide adoption.*

**The race is on!**
> It's sad, but what have they really won?

This will buy years for the legacy banking and payments industry if BCH can't rise up.
While there might be an opportunity here for "free coins" what you just described sounds like a total shitshow to all but the most sophisticated crypto investor which validates the OP's point.
Dear /u/evoorhees I'm glad you're finally getting it about rbitcoin but please don't act like the people in this sub haven't been trying to get the message through for literally years that rbitcoin has become a den of cultivated disinformation designed to brainwash.
The white paper makes many things clear about the purpose of the original design.

* The mining network functions as a single global timestamp server.  It works as long as 51% of the contributors to the global machine are "honest."

* A coin is a chain of digital signatures.

* Proof of work is the mechanism for voting. Voting is performed by either extending or orphaning blocks.

* To be considered a node, you must mine.

* Honest mining is enforced by the incentive system.

* End users shouldn't be expected to run a node.

* Mining centralization is expected but the incentives still keep miners honest.

* Pruning is performed by removing chains of transactions that have only empty outputs

If you read these, you start to realize that Core has systematically attacked every single one of these:

* as blocks fill the ability of the timestamp server to sequentially order transactions degrades, transactions are instead ordered by fee

* Miners are assumed to be dishonest

* The chain of digital signatures is segregated

* Pruning is performed by removing signature history

* A node no longer mines

* All end users are expected to run non mining nodes

* Mining centralization cannot be trusted regardless of incentives

* Proof of social media dominance is the mechanism for voting. Voting is performed by BIPs and ACKs.

etc...       
Yes but OPs' last sentence still stands.

If the ecosystem can be convinced to swallow the poison pill, then the future of crypto is very uncertain.
What a disaster and embarrassment.

It's like watching 3 monkeys trying to fuck a football. 
Exactly! This guy gets it.

When it starts becoming burdensome to actually store and serve the blockchain, *then* the fee market will respond with higher fees. Because it actually costs more.
Who is Adam Back?

He is Greg Maxwell's stooge.
Nope.  So?  That doesn't make his analysis of Lightning wrong.

Rightness and wrongess is not affected by the head from which the proclamation originates.  I have upvoted many people with whom I philosophically fundamentally disagree - people I consider downright objectionable, objectively bad nasty people - because what they said was correct and the way in which it was said contributed to discussion.

I don't know the first thing about this old dude, but his argument here in the Twitter thread is very insightful.  That's the point: the argument holds up *even if* the guy is a raging bag of dicks and objectively wrong in all other regards.
Of course he did. I'm just a jackoff on the internet and I also received death and dox threats.
When you grasp that Blockstream controls rbitcoin, bitcointalk, bitcoindotorg, and various other media outlets, then you have to ask yourself how bad the shitshow is going to be if 2X actually happens.  "Bitcoin has been hijacked" -- "We're under attack" -- "Fearless crypto figureheads to the rescue" -- "See we told you the miners were evil" -- "Change PoW!! Download this new client!!" etc etc

These are narratives that people *will believe* if they are repeated from enough trusted sources, and it appears they will be repeated from enough trusted sources.

I think it'd be great if 95% of miners or whatever go riding full-charge into this shitshow because I'm covered, but it's going to be a shitshow if they do, mark my words.

I think the smart, conservative mining decision is to withdraw from NYA and mine Bitcoin Cash, and let Blockstream have the 1X chain while it chokes on its own vomit.
How to scale Bitcoin Cash and keep it decentralized.

If there are a million businesses using Bitcoin Cash at full adoption, and 1% of these run "full nodes," then that's 10,000 scalable "data-center grade" full nodes all around the world.

Unstoppable.  Visa, suck it.  World reserve currency, at scale.

This was always the plan.  The trick isn't keeping costs low, because even at scale the costs are not large for a business.  The trick is growing adoption, so the pool of interested businesses is very large.  And the way you do that, as always: 

**Build it and they will come.**
Can we please stop to consider we may be guilty of trusting too much in a poorly-understood agreement to run software when the software doesn't exist and is in a state of change even a month away from the run-by date?

Miners vote with their hashpower when they extend (or do not extend) the blocks of other miners.  These agreements to run as-yet-unseen-code were taken as golden but really they're at best a good-faith handshake, at worst, they're a complete con.

Miners should not be entering into theoretically binding agreements to run code until after the code is written and stable, so that there's actual certainty in what the code represents.  In software, even a single line, word, or character can make or break the entire agreement.
It's not that hard to do the math actually.

According to cash.coin.dance there have been 3992 more blocks mined on the Cash chain than the Legacy chain.  At 12.5 BCH/block that's 49900 extra BCHs mined in the last ~60 days.

Or you can go to coinmarketcap.com, it shows BCH 16,653,338 and BTC 16,603,525 for a difference of 49813.  Same story.

49813 coins in 63 days since the fork means 830 bch/day are being mined in addition to the 1800 coins expected.

1800 coins/day (normal expected BTC output) represents 4% inflation.  2630 BCH/day represents 5.84% inflation, which is **46% higher inflation** than the expected 4% inflation.  Burning through the remaining coins 46% faster than expected is **not insignificant.**

I think this is not good.  Moreover the wild swings in block output is not conducive to a good user experience, and probably affect security negatively as well.  It needs to be addressed, sooner not later.

Before someone calls me a concern troll [BCH PLS](https://jessquit.threadless.com/designs/bch-pls/mens/t-shirt?color=royal_blue)
Censorship and community division within Bitcoin have been the best thing that could have possibly happened to Vitalik Buterin.
Blockstream's Adam Back and crew have been spouting this drivel for years that "a controversial hard fork is not possible" and then proceeded to gin up as much controversy as humanly possible. People that listen to the things he says think that the world will end if there's a hard fork. He even convinced these people that if a hard fork happens, next thing you know we'll remove the inflation limit and start printing bitcoins.  He really did.  So the people that hang out in rbitcoin are super paranoid.

Meanwhile, in the land of free speech and thought, we recognized that in the case of true controversy, a hard fork is actually the economically efficient (win-win) outcome, and not to be feared. Then Ethereum hard forked and proved us right. But lots of people still think that a hard fork is really the end of the world, though none of them can offer a convincing argument why, or point to a real world example.

Realize that Blockstream has a direct financial interest in preventing onchain scaling.
A thread on that post:

>>As someone who admittedly knows relatively little about the tech, I've yet to hear why segwit/LN tech won't lead to centralized hubs for payment channels.

/u/hairy_unicorn writes:
> The question is: why would it?

Hi /u/hairy_unicorn.

The answer to this question is that to create a lightning network channel, one must lock a little capital into it.

Those with the most capital to lock up can create the most channels.

Those who can create the most channels turn themselves into the hubs of a hub-and-spoke emergent network.  This solves routing and allows dominant players to collect fees.

Lightning Network scales with capital.  [Capital is distributed like this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/01/22/10-startling-facts-about-global-wealth-inequality/).  You can expect Lightning Hubs to also be similarly arranged, with a few dominant hubs providing most of the channels.

The components are peer-to-peer, but the emergent topology is hub-and-spoke.
Thanks, this is what I've been saying all along.

SW2X gets us ~12 tps.  With the same block size limit, regular-old-8MB blocks gets us ~24 tps.   Segwit is anti-scaling (it does enable witness pruning, which is nice, but doesn't help scaling, since storage is not a significant bottleneck).
There are people, I don't know if Luke's one of them, but quite likely.... anyway, there are these goldbug people who think that since "Bitcoin's closest competitor is physical gold" then the marginal cost of a Bitcoin transaction is the cost to send physical gold anywhere in the world in about an hour - ie the closest alternative to Bitcoin would be to expedite a gold shipment.

Lunatics.  Maximalists to the point that they don't even realize that altcoins are *actual competition.*
Segwit 2X was a bait and switch. Myself and many others argued strenuously against it on the grounds that enabling the soft fork but delaying the hard fork was a prima facia case of bad faith. The history of this sub is full of people like myself making this case. And we were proven right.

We always said that the victory endgame is when banks and governments have to mine in order to stay relevant: they aren't capturing the blockchain, they're being enslaved to it.

This has always been the goal, and Craig is 100% dead-on-balls-accurate in his characterization of the situation.

PSA: there is no need to use Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Cash preserves both the "store of value" concept and the "P2P cash" concept as originally intended.

The magic isn't having digital gold or digital cash.

**The magic is realizing that your digital gold can also be also your digital cash.**
No, wrong, wrong.  Truth is truth because it's correct.  CSW is just some guy.
Tarnished?
I suspect they are.

Isn't the most awesome play of all to:

1. Become devs of Bitcoin

2. Buy alts

3. Take a big shit on the Bitcoin code and community

4. Profit

/s
Two years of progress stalled and Segwit turned into a bizzarro soft fork all because this guy was so wrong but people listened to him anyway. 

A hard fork is the best thing for Bitcoin particularly if it's contentious as I've been trying to get through to Adam for some time now.
This is a good question. I started to rebut it, but I'll go along. I personally spend too much energy refuting what I see are waves of endless shills here to mindlessly promote Lightning, because I wouldn't want wanderers-by to see statements not being challenged. Even if I'm wrong, at least let there be debate.

That said, just yesterday I had an actual shower thought. As in, I was showering, and thinking that back in 2013 it seemed like every week someone was trying to figure out how to start a closed loop Bitcoin economy, and by 2014 all anyone could talk about was "TA," and that it sure would be good to go back to talking about how to start a closed loop Bitcoin economy again.

So, have my upvote.

Now. About creating a closed loop Bitcoin economy..... 
>There is also something to be said about how you listen to full albums with vinyl.

Yes, we've often commented that one of the best things about LP VINYL is that it makes it easier to listen to music in ~20 min chunks. This discourages single - hopping but also times out before the listener gets too bored. When CD came out it was like everyone wanted to make 17 song albums. I know I'm not alone when I say that there are very few albums that are so good that I actually want there to be 17 songs much less listen to all of them at a stretch.

You know how "muffin tops" is about getting just the best part of the muffin?  The LP is like getting a pair of "album tops."

TOPOLOGY MATTERS

WAKE UP
The post from 2015 is about the "temporary" policy of banning everyone from rbitcoin who advocates on behalf of the original Bitcoin scaling plan - a "temporary" policy still in force today.  That is censorship.

You continue to be uncensored. Your post remains for all to see, we continue to interact in public, and you have not been banned from the sub.

Those are the facts.
Offers to make a quarter million dollar charitable contribution in order to stop censorship in rBitcoin and you call him a scumbag.

Well then. We know which side you're on.
This right here is why I deleted my Twitter account last year. Apparently there is no minimum IQ required to participate.
We already did the blocksize increase. It was only five months ago, and it was so staunchly opposed by Core that it split the coin.  If you want a block size increase, sell your broken small block coins for working large block coins. That's the only viable upgrade path left.

Then there was another proposal for a block size increase that had massive community support. It was called sw2x. Core opposed that and managed to block it, too. That was only six weeks ago.

Raising the block size now would be arguably the single greatest admission of wrongness in the history of people being wrong.

Even if they did this, anyone paying attention (and I agree this could be the minority) would have to spot the obvious political games being played and choose to participate in a coin project / community that isn't clearly managed by incompetent trolls.  You can't build a business around self-absorbed, capricious, even user-spiteful project management like that.
I love what you've written here.  /u/tippr .001 bch

However I think you do miss the very real possibility that this isn't just some engineering circlejerk but actually a very deliberate attempt to throttle capacity and stall Bitcoin's adoption by trotting out vaporware solutions to scaling.

Before another person gets on me for using the term "vaporware" please understand that the term doesn't only mean *totally nonexistent code* it refers to any "solution" that doesn't really work today but which can be held up as a rebuttal to deflect the adoption of the competition's alternative solution.   An example is Segwit as an alternative to a 2MB block size increase, or Lightning as an alternative to significantly larger blocks.

Vaporware is usually advertised to eventually work better than the competitor's product and therefore be superior, even though the competitor's product is actually currently the superior product and the vaporware product has unresolved issues.  The important thing to note about vaporware is that goal is usually *primarily to prevent the client from going with the competitors product*.  IF you can dangle some vaporware in front of a client and merely *defer* the decision to adopt the competitor's product then that in and of itself is a victory even if the vaporware itself is never chosen (ie SW2X).  A stall is considered a "vaporware win."

Think how long these guys prevented any capacity increases, **we've known this was coming since 2010 FFS.** . In service of this they really damaged the community and ran off a lot of dev talent, too.  At some point, "ruthlessly getting one's way" and "overt sabotage" become hard to distinguish, no?
It's like a cancer that feels like it's won because it finally ate up the whole body.
Help me understand something.

Lead Core dev and Blockstream CTO is posting deliberate misinformation in fake sub, rbitcoin mod post links to fake sub trying to drive actual bitcoin users to fake websites and puppet subreddits and that *shouldn't* get called out?  It's literally an attack on the community of users.

Blockstream's business model depends on choking onchain scaling.
ACK

Totally permissionless, costs almost nothing, completely "within the rules", doesn't require any modification to any software whatsoever. Also further embarrasses the "there will be no split" narrative. 

Someone code this up, I'll donate the funds, let's put this to bed. 
Squat like every human did up until the invention of the sit toilet.
Exactly. The only thing that keeps your funds secure in a Lightning Network is the presumption that there is an honest, always-on monitor that can always alert you to a fraudulent close of your channel - essentially the same as being able to detect a double-spend in the mempool.

But: "being able to detect a double spend" is the exact thing that Core claims can never work when we argue for zero-confs. If you presume the existence of an honest, 100% effective monitor for Lightning, then the same concept makes zero-confs perfectly safe to use.

TLDR if you presume the existence of a monitor, as Lightning requires, then it turns out you don't need Lightning in the first place to do instant P2P payments.
I agree wholly with everything you said.  But, sometimes, people do the right thing for the greater good.

Believe me, if "real Theymos" came forward with a convincing and apologetic story, and got sued by someone for doing so, his legal defense fund would be limitless.  The Streisand effect would be seismic.
The narrative, if I understand it, is "buy Ripple because banks are great and banking is the future; also, Roger Ver once shipped some firecrackers over state lines so he's a terrorist and BCH is a scam."

As I see this narrative it's bullish for BCH.
"This is likely the work of a lone gunman."

I love ntxchg but he's bitter because deadalnix implemented an EDA fix without getting support from the other teams and then just announced it as "the plan for Bitcoin Cash."  And maybe he ought to be salty about that, but not bitter.

What he won't say, but should, is that the other three teams had basically had a replacement EDA picked for a month, and yet the debate was just going on and on while nothing got implemented, so deadalnix got frustrated and just did it cowboy style.

So really there's two sides to this story.  One is deadalnix going cowboy.  the other is the inability of the other teams to be decisive.  On this I agree with deadalnix that the inability of the other teams to take bold decisive action has been a problem ever since back in the day which is exactly why we're in this mess we're in.  However long term if one particular individual seems to be required in order to ever move anything forward, then I agree with nxtchg that is unhealthy for BCH.
Sure thing.  You may have heard that Segwit-enabled Bitcoin is being reengineered as a "settlement layer" for Lightning Network.  In this new vision of Bitcoin, *if it ever works,* users will hold Bitcoin not in wallets whose keys they exclusively control, but in "Lightning channels," which I and others who have looked into Lightning network believe will organize into a "hub and spoke" network architecture.  So funds will be routed through "lightning hubs" between end-users, breaking the "P2P cash" model of onchain bitcoin.

what is this nonsense about "confiscation"
This is exactly the reading I had when I first read the paper. It reads like gushing propaganda and makes all kinds of wild claims that it can't back up.

I didn't read deeply after that. When you read the first few pages, the degree of bias and manipulation makes you realize the authors are not objective scientists. If I have to debunk every sentence, it's too much effort for too little benefit. And the problems with the LN design were easy to spot anyway. 
"It's time to bring the big blockers back into Bitcoin."
This is actually good for Bitcoin Core (BTC).

BTC has adopted a security model of *artificial block space scarcity*. This model perforce cannot produce more revenue by growing its volume, so it requires high fees in order to support it going forward.

Whether or not this is a smart strategy remains to be seen. Color me highly skeptical. But the point remains that this is actually desired network behavior - - in fact I think many / most BTC developers would agree fees are still suboptimal. 
They're bankers, buying off devs and opinion leaders, to cripple Bitcoin and / or turn it into something the fiat banking system can exploit.  Tone Vays worked in banking. His family is in banking. Banking conglomerates are backing the BTC devs. Barry Silbert is all hooked up with bankers. Lightning Network is basically cryptobanking. What puzzle pieces are still missing?
So Core really does own BTC? So ownership is really centralized in a particular team?  What were we doing with XT, BU, and Classic all those years? Wasting our time? 

WTF is wrong with you? That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.

Edit: AFAIU Amaury was working for Bitmain at the time, so I guess you're saying it's really Bitmain owns the trademark? Also, he didn't build that client in a vacuum. I guess all the contributors own the trademark, in your opinion.  SMH.

Lightning is **NOT** "p2p" it is a *routed* payments network.

Routed != P2P

**Bitcoin** was created to be P2P cash.

Lightning *undoes* this vision.  Lightning might be a *good* payments network.  It might even be the *best ever* payments network.  But it is *not* a P2P payments network.

Did you ever think it was interesting that [the first person to suggest the block size increase was jgarzik](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.0) and the first person to shoot it down "because it will make you incompatible with the network" was Theymos, and here we are, **seven years later** and here's jgarzik proposing a patch, which Theymos shoots down because it's "incompatible with the network."

It's like some sort of dance being played out over and over.  Almost as if to be choreographed.

Aren't you the one who drove this change into BCH "come hell or high water" and now this is the second time you've implied that there is no work underway to utilize it?

At *best* this is as tone deaf as that time you trolled rbitcoin calling BCH "bcash." At worst this is validation of many of the things the SV crowd has said about you.

OK.  Let's try this.

I believe we can make the double-spend relaying code recently merged by Bitcoin Unlimited better by instead relaying double-spend proofs or some other unspendable version of the txn.

By relaying, at minimum, an unspendable version of the double-spend txn, we can still collect all the data that is required by Bitcoin Unlimited and XT (data collection was **the** reason given for merging DS relay) without increasing the likelihood that a double-spending txn gets relayed by a BU node and subsequently validated, however unlikely this might or might not be.  By doing this, we lose nothing and gain something. 

Can we come together around that?  Or something like https://www.yours.org/content/standard-priority--sp--miner-policy-and-double-spend-proof-relay-abdcb2ee8555?

Fix these three things and it becomes pretty painless to run a "fully validating node."  At most any scale, really.
> These two blockchains have differing exchange rates, network fees, and confirmation times. You can do a side by side comparison whenever you are making a payment so you can decide which payment method works best for you.

I'm with you. This is an excellent proposal and I support it 100%.
I would absolutely love it if there could be a survey that people had to take right before they bought Bitcoin.

**Question 1:**

Bitcoin is:

1. Digital gold

2. Digital cash

3. Both of the above

4. None of the above

**Question 2:**

In January typical BTC transaction fees were:

1. Nothing, transactions are usually free

2. About a penny

3. About a dollar

4. More than ten dollars

It would be utterly fascinating to know what current BTC buyers think they're buying.
Let's say I work for my living hand to mouth like damn near everyone in the real world. I want to collect my paycheck using LN. To receive money on LN requires me to already have opened a channel, which requires me to already have bitcoins with which to open the channel.

So I open a Lightning channel with a hub, that right there costs me $10+ in BTC assuming normal BTC backlogs. Now I have to fund the channel. To receive a $1000 paycheck, I'll need to open a "$2000 Lightning channel" assuming symmetrical channels, which means i have to first come up with my $1000 before I can get paid $1000.

Now note that this Lightning channel will allow me to be paid only *one time* before it has to be rebalanced. The first $1000 paycheck will move the entirety of my partner's $1000 to me exhausting the channel. If I to receive another $1000 right away I'm boned. That will require yet another onchain transaction.

Now maybe I can open an asymmetrical channel for $10 where I put in zero but my partner puts in $1000 however I'm not sure who has that kind of liquidity to throw around.
it isn't a fuckup it's deliberate

Kyle's a shill
The answer to my question is obvious: Ripple relies on a trusted authority model.

"If you don't trust the authority not to change the rules and print more coins, don't use Ripple" is the complete and truthful answer.
... and the reasons this is so important isn't because Satoshi is some sort of religious figure.  Satoshi is relevant here simply because it demonstrates that the idea of Bitcoin that Forkius and I hold isn't something that we just made up, but was instead there all along.

The reasons that this is so important is that early investors like Forkius and myself understood this aspect of Bitcoin's design up front and, not only were we OK with it, we thought *it was fucking genius.*

Satoshi invented a system that, in its fully mature state, turns mining into something like a global public utility regulated by its own insanely powerful incentive to not cheat.  This emergent network is a substitute for both cash, gold, and banking: global M1.

It's impossible to say what happens in 2140 but it's clear to see that long before that, a tremendous disruption will have taken place. That disruption is why guys like me and Forkius (if I may, Forkius) *signed up on the first place.*

So you can understand our disappointment at the new, highly watered down vision being proffered by Bitcoin Core to reimplement banking on top of crypto and limit Bitcoin to "digital gold."

That's the topology of LN on testnet.  Even with limited "capital" at play, it clearly shows that it emerges as a hub-and-spoke topology.

Hell yes it's fishy because you can develop a kick ass forum platform in a month or so with $100K, easy.  It's a *forum* not a *search engine*.  I've built forums from scratch on my own spare time before.  It's one of the simplest web apps to build.  Practically a "Hello World!" project.
> When there is a backlog, fee estimation is an unsolvable problem, like estimating the bid that would win a blind closed-bid auction.

This is so right, it isn't even "like" estimating the bid that would win a blind closed auction, it *literally is* estimating the bid that will win a blind closed auction.

This is why full blocks inherently break Bitcoin. 

Jstolfi, you might be able to help with this:

One way of describing Bitcoin is that it solves the Byzantine General's problem.  Another way Satoshi described his invention is as "a global timestamping server."  We can agree that, if there were such a thing as a global timestamping server upon whose timing everyone agreed, this would eliminate the need for blockchains (in Bitcoin's case, the blockchain is the timestamping server).

With the mempool being cleared every 10 minutes, Bitcoin *does* function as a global, decentralized timestamping server (albiet one with poor resolution at ~10mins).  Every txn in a block can be reasonably assumed to have been generated in the last 10 minutes.  This means that they are easily chronologically ordered, at least with 10 mins resolution.

I've realized for some years that "blocks are supposed to be full" is a strategic attack on Bitcoin's ability to timestamp, because with full blocks, it begins to be impossible to guess the order in which txns are received.  A txn in block 100 might have been received long after a txn in block 101.  With never-full blocks, this essentially never happens.

So we can see that full blocks breaks the timestamping functionality, but I have never really understood the full ramifications of this.  I am quite sure underneath this lies some sort of vulnerability that's being probed, and I intuitively feel this is a significant vulnerability, but I can't fully suss it out.  But it seems intuitive - the whole point of blockchains is to arrive at a consensus on the ordering of transactions, so if they become disordered, something has to give, right?

cc: /u/Falkvinge 
An orphaned block will cost the pool tens of thousands of dollars.  The txn bounty may well be worth it. 

I'm ready to accept this block. 
BCH is the Bitcoin I thought I was getting when I got BTC. Before they changed BTC to the full blocks / high fees model.
Oh look. More evidence that you and your bully buddies hijacked our permissionless peer to peer cash system:

https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43

Listen up buddy.

**Real Bitcoin** is peer to  peer **CASH**

*BTC is not cash*. It used to be, before you guys hijacked it. BTC is now a settlement token for the disastrous Lightning Network blunder.

Newsflash: if your token isn't peer to peer cash then it isn't Bitcoin.

Bitcoin **Cash** is [Bitcoin: a Peer-to-peer Electronic **Cash** System](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) and if you don't like me saying it, **you shouldn't have fucked up BTC.**
For my friend, the Blockstream shill /u/HeyZeusChrist who claims none of this happened.
This is actually a true statement as long as the keys are still in someone's possession but it misses a key point: utility is only *realized* at the time the coins move.  Until then the coins only represent an action potential.  If the coins *can't* move, then the value is lost.  And the more the coins *do* move, the more value is realized.

> If we increase the blocksize, then inevitable the number of nodes will centralize

I came here to find this.  I knew it would be here somewhere.

There's two nodes you seem to be conflating.  True network nodes, which mine; and relay/validation nodes (aka "full nodes") which don't mine.

1. If more people use the coin, because it has high capacity and supports more usecases, then the pool of users and businesses interested in running a node goes up.  So it is incorrect to say "larger blocks *perforce* means fewer nodes" because it is true that "larger blocks means more potential usecases which means more users which means more nodes."

2. The only nodes that really matter to the incentive system are miners, and "economically relevant" fullnodes.  You are not economically relevant.  Neither am I.  Wealth is distributed according to a power-law curve.  That means that 90-99% of the network is not economically relevant, and the incentives will hold even if they're driving off the network.  Larger blocks may drive out some hobby nodes, but again, the more usecases, the more people who want to run professional nodes, and those are better for the network.

3. No "economically relevant" fullnode (Coinbase, BitPay, etc) is in any way challenged by the cost to run a node, even at scale, unless and until we actually start hitting real technology limits which are still three or four orders of magnitudes away *at least.* . For the foreseeable future, running a node will remain very inexpensive.

4. The cost of mining is not driven by the cost to transmit and store data.  This is a tiny tiny fraction of the cost to mine.  The cost to mine is driven by the enormous computational /and energy expense of hashing.   A miner could have $20M of S9 miners miners all running against the same $20K node.  The only thing that miner thinks about all day is the cost of electricity and the price of bitcoins on the market.  The cost of the data transmission and storage is insignificant, even at scale.  What a miner cares about is not minimizing the cost of the data, but maximizing the value of the block rewards he is earning.

5. At scale, some miners may misallocate too much capital to hashpower, and not enough to bandwidth.  Those miners will be replaced by other miners who allocate more bandwidth. 

6. Allowing bandwidth to become a driver may actually lessen the hashpower race and create a storage and validation and transmission race that isn't dependent on cheap energy.  This may well have the effect of driving mining away from remote places with cheap energy and towards populous places with cheap networking.  That would be good for Bitcoin.

You should be President of BTC.
You don't get it. Driving transactions off the blockchain is *exactly* BTCs intent.

I'm trying to understand the point of 2X.

I get 1X - sorta - the point is to absolutely limit onchain transactions to move activity onto 2nd layer solutions.

I get Bitcoin Cash - the point is to un-limit onchain transactions insofar as possible to stimulate adoption and growth.

But 2X seems like a useless compromise.  You still changeover the codebase to Segwit, which is problematic on many levels, and you only get a one-time bump to 2X, after which the same dynamics of capacity limitation start over again.  And how are you "firing Core" by *running Segwit* just because it has jgarzik's seal of approval on it?  I don't get it.

If you want to fire Core, run Cash.  That's what firing Core really looks like.

Note: I don't disclose my trades but I'm not "all in" on any coin
1. Create LN and deploy on capacity-strangled network

2. Banks (& LN whales that become banks) adopt for settlements, drive out all but the most expensive onchain usecases

3. Network centralizes around these banking hubs which are the last of the "fullnodes"

4. Governments require licensing to mine or relay onchain Bitcoin transactions, require AML/KYC on L2

5. Bitcoin, pwned
LoL I did Y2K replatforming of an old RPG app, it is you who have no idea what you're talking about, troll.  Y2K was not a "one line of code" change you bozo.
Greg was disinterested in Bitcoin until he discovered the attack vector.
[I should have seen this coming when I caught Greg Maxwell trying to fly the completely fabricated argument that Satoshi "urgently urged" people not to increase the blocksize.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5fjzty/satoshi_favored_onchain_scaling_because_security/dalckl2)

(For the record, the specific quote which Greg failed to attribute was Satoshi's reply to *a [specific patch hastily proposed by jgarzik](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.0)* not a statement against larger blocks at all.  In fact, later in the same thread, *Satoshi proposes how to make blocks larger.*)

I'm not making this up - read the thread.  That's the level of intellectual dishonesty that this guy maintains.  It's Newspeak.
Honestly the 800lb YOLO gorilla in the room is Segwit+Lightning as a scaling solution for Bitcoin. 

"Hey, I have an idea.  There's this pie-in-the-sky half-baked idea called Lightning Network.  It will require a massive rewrite of the Bitcoin client and nobody has any idea if it will work.  I'd give it six months or so to be ready.  Let's be everything on this!  What could go wrong?"

This comment high up in the thread was very illustrative of Core thought processes:

> That’s unfortunate. I disagree with most he says. It’s not that their not openminded, it’s that when ur trying to overhaul the financial system as we know it, “move fast and break things” is not the answer. This is what makes BTC different.

We're not trying to "overhaul the financial system" you bozo we're *disintermediating it entirely.*

Move over or die, dinosaur.

Or anything way to put it....

If destroying the financial system as we know it will damage your portfolio, you're holding the wrong assets, dumbass.
It is a true statement that if a majority of miners start violating the consensus rules, an SPV client on its own will be unable to detect this violation.

The part they leave out is that in this event, all full nodes will detach themselves from the majority chain, so they can't transact safely anyway. Since this is basically a nuclear attack against Bitcoin, everyone's fucked, full node or not.

The other point they leave out is that even at very high scale the cost to maintain a full node is still quite low and well within the budgets of millions of companies and individuals, so we can expect that lots and lots of individual validation will always be taking place anyway.

*The only thing a full node protects you from is Nakamoto Consensus.*
I don't mind Segwit / Lightning Network, I mind it stealing the original (superior) Bitcoin scaling plan.

If you don't think Bitcoin will work, that's OK, but you're supposed to mine an altcoin, not [soft-fork](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/03/14/forks_and_markets.html), [censor](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/), and [bait-and-switch](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6hm7kb/are_we_about_to_get_screwed_segwit2x_discussion/dizg0r6/) your altcoin project into the Bitcoin brand name.
This is not *my* philosophy, my friend.  I'm merely repeating Luke's philosophy back to him.  As Luke or any UASFer will tell you, you can't trust the hashpower majority, because "miners don't make the rules."  That is why  people [like this guy](https://medium.com/@lopp/securing-your-financial-sovereignty-3af6fe834603) have been telling us that you have to "run your own node to protect your financial sovereignty."  **Because just following the hashpower majority is a recipe for disaster**, according to them.

Well neat.  That means that I get to say "BCH is valid Bitcoin" because those are the rules I enforce.

They don't like that, so since they have a hashpower majority, they want to fall back on hashpower majority as the final determinant of validity.  OK great.  I agree!  Now remind us all again what that "validation" node is protecting you from?  It sounds like it's protecting you from accidentally following *the real Bitcoin.*

All I can say is, checkmate.

Good post. Have an upvote. I'm happy you're taking this to task.  If you can show that Dave wasn't involved with Bitcoin at all, but just painted in conveniently after his death, that would be very newsworthy.

Wikipedia claims "In 2011 Kleiman founded W&K Info Defense Research LLC (“W&K”) in Florida as a company to mine bitcoins" but I can't see where they substantiate that.

Dave's brother Ira claims that it is "irrefutable" that Dave was somehow involved with early Bitcoin. That's no proof, but he will have to present evidence in court to that effect, so I'm interested to see that proof.

Good luck!  The truth will set you free... But first or will probably piss you off :)
CSW is proof of tweet
I **am** a Bitcoin maximalist. That is why I support Bitcoin Cash.
The [story of how they got control of the BTC brand and turned it into an altcoin](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/z/dl8v4lp) is strange, fascinating, and true.  Must-read material.

BTC is basically an ICO for Lightning Network. Holding a BTC is a bet on that unproven technology, but people treat it like it's the same technology that got us from 2009-2016.  That technology lives on in Bitcoin Cash (BCH).
It's the new talking point: blame is on BCH for forking. I literally just got into it with an rbitcoiner who had the balls to quote me this tasty Pieter Wiulle quote:

>What the Bitcoin Core team should do, in my opinion, is merge any consensus change that is uncontroversial.

Pretty ironic when it was Wiulle who coded and merged **the single most controversial change ever in the history of cryptocurrency** that divided the community irreparably: Segwit.

> keeping fees down

Ahhhh... there's your error

/* strokes neckbeard */

We at Bitcoin Core do not want to "keep fees down."  That is the misunderstanding here.

Bitcoin's creator made many, many mistakes.  One of these mistakes was that he made the coin deflationary, with an emission schedule that prints most of the coins in the first ten years.  This means that for the next 130 years, there just won't be enough coins made to keep the network secure, because we've looked into it, and there's no way Bitcoins will continue to double in value every four years.  Starting now and disregarding all price history.

That is why Bitcoin Core believes it's critical to Create A Fee Market.  Only by Creating A Fee Market now will we switch over from a "subsidy-based" security model to a "fee-based" security model which is sure to happen in 130 years when the subsidy completely ends, but preferably in 13 months.  It's Proven Fact that the subsidy can't work, so the sooner we make it irrelevant, the better.  We already know a lot about the future and can make very good estimates of future technologies 130 years out, so we should make those decisions now.

Bitcoin's Creator made another error, which is believing that he had created P2P Cash.  He didn't.  He created a form of digital precious metal, like physical gold.  The cost and time to move physical gold is very very high - it can cost millions of dollars to securely move gold, and it can take days.  Therefore the market can be expected to pay "next-best" prices for similar wait times.  Million-dollar fees for days-long confimations is the best our competition can do, so we should expect at least thousand-dollar fees for similar wait times.

It's a mistake to think that high fees are bad.  High fees are good, because they mean more security.  What's bad is moving your coins.  Coins are never supposed to move.  That's why high fees are actually good.  

Remember, "the price can't move if the coins can't move" - so high fees are actually helping your Bitcoins store value better!
You can't be pro-Bitcoin and think that Bitcoin isn't supposed to be used as Cash. 

> read the white paper

The damn thing is called "[Peer to Peer Electronic **Cash**](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)" for Christ's sake.  You go read it, dumbass.


 If you think it shouldn't be Cash, then you're anti-Bitcoin.
> Bcash should be used everywhere for payments, and thus be the medium of exchange (think spending account). Bitcoin can then quite happily be the store of value (savings account). 

Why do I need a "store of value" coin when my "cash" coin has the exact same inflation, immutability, and the same hashpower protecting it - in fact, the Cash coin has every property of the "store of value" coin with only one exception - it's fast and cheap.

BTC is like gold that works like *gold.*

**Real** [**Bitcoin** - a Peer-to-Peer Electronic **Cash** System](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) is like gold that works like *cash.*

also, dude.  "bcash" is a zcash clone / scamcoin thing, you don't want to call it that, or risk being labelled a scammer.
> there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together

As long as this is the most important thing it will always be impossible to upgrade onchain capacity, because it will always be possible to fund sufficient opposition to disrupt the community.
Lightning Network was obvious vaporware just upon reading the wildly overhyped white paper that promised the moon and the sun without a single line of code as a proof of concept.

We were promised this would be working a year ago. We're nowhere close.  In fact they're just starting to address the actual problems.

Anyone that isn't *highly* skeptical of the entire project is either selling or drinking Koolaid.   
Luke is doing the noble thing: he's taking his beliefs and leading a fork to see them through. It's a free market and I for one applaud Luke for doing what he thinks is best. We big blockers didn't have the cojones ourselves to fork last year even though we clearly had a plurality of miners behind us. When Luke and his followers create a fork that suits them, it means that they quit fighting us to impose these changes. They simply leave and start working on a version of Bitcoin that suits their beliefs better.

I don't have to agree with these beliefs to support Luke's right to explore them freely. This is the spirit of *permissionless innovation.*

Greg is wrong and this shows why his so called expertise is totally overrated.

A hard fork is NON COERCIVE. This is obvious to everyone who is going to sit out UASF. It will simply pass them by like a puff of cloud. People who don't run UASF will simply carry on as usual, because for them, **nothing has changed.**

By comparison, a soft fork, imposed by miners on everyone, is COERCIVE. Segwit, when imposed, *will become part of MY MONEY -- EVEN IF I never use it.*     
I'm guessing Satoshi wasn't making the unreasonable assumption that this level of adoption would happen instantaneously.
Of course LN will centralize. Even without the obvious, glaring problem you bring up, decentralized routing is an unsolved problem, and the network (if people use it) will require centralized hubs.

But then nobody even has a straight answer on whether or not LN is supposed to work for anything but micropayments...

What a joke this community is.
My offer to discuss this with Peter stands.

At it is, he appears to be a technically unqualified newcomer who nevertheless believes he's qualified to pass judgment on the tech and the history. I've offered to discuss with him but he tends to just take potshots here and there and never responds to my requests for actual discussion. I conclude he's not earnest.
So what now, is political orientation going to be the basis for the next split? I've seen maybe a dozen politically charged posts here in the last 24hrs or so. We trying to fracture the community on political lines this time? 
Help me understand how

>There is no block size limit in BCH

I still have a niggling of doubt about one aspect of this change that I feel continues to be swept under the rug.  I would be grateful for a better understanding of this.

Based on my understanding of the original design of the "timestamping system", miners would order transactions in blocks chronologically, in the order in which they were received by the miner who finds the next block.  We know that got changed later with "sort by fee" which basically threw out any concept of FIFO processing.  But Satoshi envisioned miners mining FIFO.

While it is true that there is no universally privileged frame of reference, assuming miners follow this policy generally, the design should product relatively chronological ordering to within a few seconds for most transactions, with a reasonably narrow confidence interval, provided miners are well-connected.  It's not 100% guaranteed in all cases, but it bakes in a reasonable accurate "timeline" of "what order did these txns appear on the network."

Now, I understand that the system "works" without this ordering.  However, I still question whether or not there could be some critical use case that we're eliminating by removing the chronological ordering.  I would feel more comfortable about the change if I felt like other, more informed people were taking this possibility seriously.  Once we throw out the bathwater, it's hard to get the baby back.

That said I do appreciate the benefits offered by CTOR or other ordering schemes, and agree that at least on the surface, they offer significant potential benefit.

___

Edit: here's an example off the top of my head of an application that might be degraded by moving to CTOR.  Let's say that we use the blockchain as a witness for patent applications.  I hash my patent's content and submitted this in a txn  to prove the approximate time of its existence.   By coincidence, my arch-rival *also* does the same thing, but his txn is submitted five minutes later.  Both txns are hashed into the same block.

If the txns are ordered FIFO, we can say with a certain degree of confidence that my application was first.  With CTOR ordering, we can't say anything about the relative order of the txns within a block.

The blockchain is probabilistic not deterministic.  Yes, the relative order of txns in a block has only a certain level of confidence -- but *some* confidence is more information than *no* confidence.  *Some* ordering information is present in the noise.  By moving to CTOR or another ordering scheme, such confidence is removed entirely, unless I'm missing something.

I present this application merely as food-for-thought.  I would like to see more people thinking critically along these lines.

Edit: here's another application based on P2P cash.  Alice and Bob are both bidding for my item.  Alice sends me 1BCH then five minutes later Bob sends me 1BCH.  Both are mined into the same block.  Who wins the item?  With FIFO processing, we can say with some confidence that Alice wins the item.  With CTOR it's just a tie, neither can win.
Study finds that zero of the thousands of articles bitching about energy consumption ever point out that the real efficiency issue is the block size limit.

Oddly enough, Adam, Eric, etc gave good advice here.

Core's strategy makes perfect sense, actually, if you imagine them to actually be long BCH.
> after the November 2X fork. I think that is too late

I agree.  It would be better if EDA could be fixed before the 2X fork, so that Bitcoin Cash could be seen as a more viable / competitive alternative to the Segwit forks.
Roger, the BCC chain is almost certain to die in the 90 days until HF activation. It won't exist as a fallback if we don't support it now. This is exactly why the HF is delayed in the first place.
One of the purported benefits of CTOR is the ability to shard out validation to multiple machines because the block ordering scheme makes it inherently easy to know which machine is validating which txn.

Ultimately the ability to scale a single node across multiple machines is going to be what enables "global class" scaling but we are still a ways off from implementing sharded nodes.

>no I am never OK with mob rule

Where was your voice of reason when the mob shouted down a perfectly reasonable 2X block size increase? Where were you when the mob ruthlessly threw out all the big blockers? I remember one feeble comment you made about not being okay with censorship but nothing meaningful.

> if you notice i'm arguing against the de-listing of a coin some of who's promoters seem to want to send legal threats my way :)

Yes I see that, you're also arguing against the de-listing of a coin whose existence has been very helpful to your cause.

> their head developer was totally incompetent.

Jeff Garzik has a pretty long history as a dev.  Saying he's "totally incompetent" is a stretch.

> the code had, not one, but two embarrassing off-by-one bugs.

I agree these were embarrassing bugs.  Remind me if the SW2X code ever finalized or were these bugs that were found in testing?

Satoshi IIRC also had an off-by-one bug in his released code and he may have invented one of the more interesting applications of computer science in modern history, so the existence of such a bug shouldn't imply that the person who made the error is automatically "totally incompetent."

> the realization that the 2X fork made no technical or political sense

That's the real reason right there.  If it had actually made sense, the software would have been made to work.  Thing is, nobody really wanted it, which is why I think Garzik was just going through the motions at the end (if not going through the motions all along).

Your $114 in BTC are now effectively worthless, these coins are now effectively dust.  It's as if you destroyed the key and now they're frozen for all time.

That's **deflation**.  That means that the value of your $114 was just redistributed among all the wealthier wallets, an economic confiscation of wealth from poor wallets to rich wallets

Same here. My node can support very large blocks and doesn't cost me an extra penny, but these transaction fees are insane.

There was never a promise for cheap nodes, only cheap transactions.

Edit: actually the promise of cheap nodes was made - they're called SPV nodes and Core has worked tirelessly to prevent their use and scuttle development.
> I think it's more accurate to refer to the blocksize limit as a DoS protection and not a spam filter

**THIS**

Each miner is free to "filter spam" simply by choosing his own fee threshold.  No block size limit is needed - in fact, a block size limit makes a spam attack *more* successful.
I think BU needs to get honest with itself. It stated that it wants to be neutral with regards to Bitcoin forks. It's it? No. BTC is not really supported nor are any of the other BTC forks like Bitcoin Gold or Diamond. Only BCH is *fully* supported.

Instead of trying to genuflect towards neutrality Bitcoin Unlimited needs to just get honest that (A) you can't be everything to everyone and (B) some forks are simply not compatible with BUs mission.

Buuuut "you can just close your channel."
Maybe you're new here. This sub predates BCH by years. We're mostly big blockers who [got kicked out of rbitcoin because we thought it was stupid to shoot ourselves in the face with a tiny unproductive blockchain](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess) and had the audacity to think Bitcoin was a permissionless system where you didn't have to go along with other people's bad ideas.

Turns out that cryptocurrencies are actually just brand names people buy and keep on centralized exchanges because they manifest fiat lambos and it doesn't matter if the underlying tokens don't possess any actual real world utility so our struggle for utility may have been in vain. Boy have we learned a hard lesson. 
Around three months ago when BSV came active on the scene every single BCH troll disappeared, and I mean literally every single one. In the year before that there were a large number of active anti-BCH trolls. They even have an active sub r/bitcoin. Up until last year you could go down to the bottom of pretty much any thread in r/btc and see many of the usual trolls who were heavily downvoted for saying something along the lines of "bcash btrash bcrash", "You guys and your onchain coffee purchases" etc. But suddenly this fall they all disappeared. Instead a new type of BCH user appeared. Someone who said they were fully in support of BCH but they just so happened to support every single thing nchain and its employees said and did. They had the exact same tone as the trolls who had disappeared. Their way to talking to people was aggressive, they'd call people names, they had a relatively poor understanding of how bitcoin fundamentally worked. They were extremely argumentative.   Naturally they get heavily downvoted by the real users in r/btc. They spend their time constantly causing as much drama as possible. At every opportunity they scream about "censorship" in r/btc while they are happy about the censorship in r/bitcoincashSV. These people are astroturfers. What someone somewhere worked out, is that all you have to do to take down a community is say that you are on their side. It is an astoundingly effective form of psychological attack.

I got into a fight some time ago with a lead Core dev who tried hard to convince me that pools were bad. When I tried to argue that without pools, mining would only be feasible for giant miners, he quit talking to me.

It's a chimera.  It's a perpetual motion machine.  When you read the wild claims of its white paper, and compare them to reality, it's hard not to conclude it's a scam.

I used to feel that keeping everyone's coffee transaction on the blockchain forever was a bad idea.

But then I found out that one man's coffee transaction is another man's monthly income, and who am I to deny someone their right to use the blockchain to secure their monthly income?
I think /u/jstolfi makes many excellent points and overall I agree heartily with his analysis.

However I think he does not consider the possibility that Greg doesn't actually think he's right and that his ideas will work, but instead is just trying to troll bitcoin into self-destruction. 
**Sw2X:**

Max payload: 8MB

Expected max throughput: ~12tps

~ vs ~

**8MB big blocks:**

Max payload: 8MB

Expected max throughput: **~24tps**

Also not maintained by Core!

Compatible with Segwit later if desired!

That right there is why there's an enormous schism in Bitcoin. 

You are correct that virtually no end user needs to download and verify the entire chain.

You are also correct that a few MB every ten mins is also a very small amount of data to be worried about. 

Isn't it amazing how clear this all is to someone that hasn't yet been brainwashed by rbitcoin? 
Note: in the white paper

* "nodes" refers to "fully mining nodes" as is clear from its use in the text

* "honest nodes" refers to "economically rational miners" - miners who are in the business of mining Bitcoin for profit; miners who want the Bitcoin they mine to be worth more today and in the future
Fairly quickly I sized up CSW as a fraud, but that didn't make him automatically wrong.  I didn't "follow him" but I watched and waited to see what his actions would turn out to be.  I waited too long.

And various missteps by other parties made it difficult to know who really had BCH's best interests at heart.
Sure he did. He *believed* that he and Greg and their social media team could corrupt development and exploit the block size limit to emasculate the threat to banking, and they *believed* they could sell this plan to banking conglomerates, and he furthermore *believed* he and the other latecomers could use this manipulation to profit from copy-pastecoins like Litecoin.

So he's a believer all right. A believer in the dark side.
> It makes much more sense to leave the blocksize at 32mb until blocks reach ~16mb

It makes even more sense to build a client that can accept 128MB or 1GB blocks without choking on its own vomit, then soft-limit down to 32MB until such time as larger blocks are needed.
>BCH supporters have always been happy with centralised solutions.

Please note that I am advancing this argument simply because it was the argument foisted against large-blockers from 2015-2017 and the argument used to justify the "UASF" and "NO2X" movements.

Small blockers have told us for years (particularly when it seemed like Bitcoin Unlimited was about to get a majority of hashpower) that *total hashpower wasn't enough -- it had to be valid hashpower to matter.* . That is why every user was encouraged to run a "full node" - so he could ensure that blocks were valid according to *his* definition of validity.  See [this](https://medium.com/@lopp/securing-your-financial-sovereignty-3af6fe834603) for an example of the dogma.

Well, according to that dogma, then I, and others like me, determine what makes Bitcoin "valid" by choosing what consensus rules to follow.

Fine.  By that definition, BCH is Bitcoin.  QED.

>My view is that Bitcoin Cash strongly resembles the Bitcoin community of 2014. This is not good. That experiment was tried and it didn't work.

It's very interesting that you say that.  What are the key similarities in your opinion?

>*  The Ethereum guys already answered this question and are making plans to abandon it.

I think that's an interesting opinion too.  Proof of work allows for innovation and competition. Proof of stake is basically, "the more money you have, the more money you earn." Please set me straight.

>* a tyranny of whoever could impose their will the most aggressively.

I have an opinion on that too :)

Unfortunately when the aggressors showed up, we attempted to take them on head-on (ie XT) instead of simply splitting the currency early and going our separate ways. Back then there was an insane amount of FUD surrounding a coin split, with some people asserting it was "impossible" or that it would definitely, absolutely devalue the coin. Since then we've have two major coin splits (Ethereum & Bitcoin) and the data is clear: when a community is sufficiently divided, splitting the coin is an economically efficient, win-win outcome that raises the value of the entire ecosystem.

It is my view that the BOLD action that we should have taken in 2014-15 was to say, "ok, you guys do your small block thing and we'll do our big block thing." Imagine if the split had happened years earlier, we wouldn't be here now I don't think.

Any second thoughts about the all-or-nothing approach that was taken?
You have to realize that the use case of most altcoins vanishes in a puff of smoke if BCH just works.
> Roger’s comments are all being mass downvoted

I downvoted Roger's comments because his reply frankly sucks.  Wake up.  *Even if* OP is trolling, Roger's reply is simply completely unacceptable as the CEO of my wallet provider.
Space travel has not been revolutionary yet. What it has done is demonstrate the possibility of future revolution, and it has accelerated the development of related technologies.  That made it very important, and ultimately it will become revolutionary, but it's still way too early.

Consider the first boats. A few people going out on boats and reporting back isn't the revolution. The improvements in waterproofing learned by boat pioneers aren't the revolution.

The revolution is "boating."

Joel Barker has a lot of good material on this subject. There's a big difference between invention, innovation, and revolution.
Can we be frank?

Why did Satoshi choose an inflation schedule that doesn't end for 140 years? Why 140?

Easy. 140 years is roughly two full ~~generations~~ lifetimes of humans.

Satoshi intentionally designed the coin so that, after being globally adopted, future generations could choose for themselves what to do about inflation, fees, and security.  There is no living human who will ever have to face a future where there is no block subsidy.

Let's be frank about something else.

In 120 more years if blockchain running on von Neumann computers is still the best way to do "money" then something has probably gone terribly wrong with society.
> over time, the community found out that that wouldn’t be possible at scale without harming censorship resistance

No, Cobra. The community found nothing of the sort out. In fact, the only thing harmed by bigger blocks is *censorship itself.*
I'd like to propose /u/Peter__R 
excellent argument also fails to take into account step-function improvements in efficiency like xthin / graphene; xthin is practically an iteration of Moore's Law right there.

also: we're ready for big blocks today but we're still a long way from needing 1GB blocks, all these numbers assume the most aggressive adoption imaginable.  Yeah, we can do that.
> a shame that these coins were awarded without validating transactions.

Satoshi mined like a million coins validating fewer transactions than were mined under EDA.  And he was just one guy.
Obvious scam is obvious.
Jihan get your shitty $10M spam off the network.  $100M minimum. /s
Good point. Bitcoin is about to get a bad rap. Maybe better to maintain a clear and separate brand identity.
The real question is how much dumb money is actually following that narrative and what's the best way to take it from them?
This fork is the culmination of over a year of various efforts by different developers.

Some of it was, perforce, rushed: the NYA and UASF efforts this summer brought the issue to a head. Previously almost all of the work was being performed on the hope that the community and a majority of miners would come together around a *united* bigger block fork. Until the NYA, bigger blocks (specifically EC but including 2MB and 8MB proposals) had a near majority of hashpower signaling, while Segwit languished at ~30%.

Then, without warning, the so-called New York Agreement was signed and the next thing anyone knew we were on the fast track for Segwit activation, with the promise (LOL) of an uncontentious hard fork to 2MB some time later.

Immediate evasive action was required. So Bitcoin ABC was born to support the fork. We knew that with the NYA signed that there was no way to get a hashpower majority. So by necessity the EDA was added. As I see it the EDA serves to:

1. Ensure that the original ledger be preserved, which requires that it remains viable to mine even at a fraction of hashpower and market value

2. Have minimal code footprint; change nothing else about difficulty / incentives. The compressed timeline required a Minimum Viable Fork: the least amount of change to the code required to cross the hurdle of sustaining the fork

What we have now, like what we had before, is still imperfect, but the original ledger is being preserved, and the clients have remained sufficiently stable to support the fork. I'm really proud of what's been achieved, though I had no part in coding it, I believe I helped shape and actualize it nonetheless.   
Then you should be made aware that the Bitcoin community has been under a social engineering attack since some time around 2014 and this is a continuation of the same attack.  If we cannot resist this attack, then the same fate that befell Original Bitcoin will likely befall Bitcoin Cash and frankly any other altcoin that comes into the crosshairs.   No lie.   
Because I believe my Bitcoin will be worth more if the chain splits, just as my Ethereum were worth more after its chain split.

When a community is divided, as ours is, a chain split produces an economically preferential outcome with respect to a one size fits all solution.

Large non-Segwit blocks have miner support. 80% may be signaling for SW2X but 40+% are also signaling BU and that percentage has been increasing. The fork will be economically viable, even if it is a minority fork.

I have serious doubts that SW2X will produce a 2X hardfork, but I plan to hold my coins on both chains.
And they're wearing hot all-black clothing and carrying several pounds of gear, try running in the summer wearing that rig.

I'm pointing out a simple additional disadvantage that cops have, in addition to not training like Marines. OK? Thanks.  
Segwit is absolutely not *battle tested.* We have no idea how the witnesses data can be gamed. It represents a fundamental change to onchain transactions. 
Ultimately these things are all about tradeoffs.

Read "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" to understand something about where we were with institutionalization in this country in the mid-20th century.  A commitment was a sentence to a freakshow in which you might become the star, and mental illnesses were even more poorly understood then than they are now.

So it's understandable that the move to deinstitutionalization came about in no small part as a human rights issue.  Unfortunately, we seem to have created a new, different human rights issue in the meantime.

As the friend of a schizophrenic (deceased) all I can say is that my opinion is that the issue is terribly painful.  I watched my friend institutionalized and released many times and all I can say is that there are no easy answers in some cases of severe mental illness.  Maybe one day the answers will be easier.
What hypocrisy. BTC has been run by mob rule since 2014 and /u/adam3us has been perfectly okay with it all this time because the mob's supported him. Where was Adam's voice of reason when the mob shouted down a perfectly reasonable 2X block size increase? Where was Adam when the mob ruthlessly threw out all the big blockers?

And big shocker here comes Adam to defend his BCH-hating friends in BSV in their time of need just like Gmax offered to help them out. Gotta *lock down the protocol*, eh Adam?

>Now that LN is up and running

No dude. Nobody ever doubted that LN could exist. It's payment channels, which have existed since 2010, extended with a limited routing capability suitable for tiny, non critical payments. 

Nobody ever said this couldn't be built. What we said was: **it won't scale without centralizing.**

Well if you accept even "compatibility with the previous version" the whole argument falls apart because that compatibility broke years ago and therefore stopped being Bitcoin years ago.

I think the correct conclusion is that compatibility with old versions isn't actually relevant when considering "what is Bitcoin?"

It's more than that.  What Rick is saying - albeit clumsily - is that the story is so blatantly absurd that it practically screams "false flag operation."

first off, it simply **isn't** insider trading, full stop.  so the story is simply wrong on its face.

secondly, nobody who matters in the Bitcoin community is asking for more government regulations.  coinbase isn't asking for this.  coinbases's competitors aren't asking for this.  holders like Rick and Roger and little guys like me aren't asking for this.  the notion is absurd.  it just didn't happen.

so what you're left with is an untrue story about manufactured outrage that just happens to create the impression that "something unfair happened" and therefore "we need the government to step in."

Rick's saying, "wake up people, this whole story is manufactured bullshit."
Great research!  /u/tippr .001 bch

I think you should consider the fact that the reason a lot of new accounts were created in rbtc was because when the mass banning, DDoS, and personal threats started being thrown around a lot of us changed our usernames in an attempt to continue to participate in the community and / or to obfuscate a perhaps poorly hidden IRL identity.  I believe long-time Bitcoiners and ex-rbitcoiners are possibly quite underrepresented in your research for this reason.

Not sure how you could control for this but it might bear mentioning.

Bitcoin is exactly Paypal 2.0 - Paypal, only decentralized and censorship-resistant!

For the *users* - who you are forcing offchain onto your banking system.
I agree with you to a point - this is a silly meme - but then, in fairness, though, what the community relies on is the part of Bitcoin Core that this team inherited.  This team's contributions overall have been modest; in terms of solving Bitcoin's biggest problem (onchain scaling) they have been a willful disaster: deliberately running us into the 1MB limit "to create a fee market" and create demand for offchain solutions.
"We want stability and conservatism" was always a lie, if you were paying attention.

Running the capacity unnecessarily into a wall "to create a fee market" and then rewriting practically the entire codebase to achieve minor benefits is the *very opposite* of "we want stability and conservatism".

Now that you've seen through this lie, I'm sure you'll start to see through many others.
> the block size limit that was put in place was always intended to be temporary and removed in a very simple almost non-event.  We read the paper and became involved and obtained the currency and were ready to scale and then suddenly a bunch of people got the impression that the plan should change.  We don't think their reasons hold up under scrutiny.

I'm 100% with this guy. When I got involved with Bitcoin the block size limit was just an anti-dos threshold that miners would raise long before we got anywhere near it. Then the soft limit got raised again and again and then the soft limit was 1MB and we were like guys srsly just raise it to even 2MB and they *literally argued that there had to be zero tolerance on this issue specifically to force pain onto the market to make it choose 2nd layer scaling*. I'll see if I can find a link.

I disagree.  ABC has provided a single "explanation" that basically amounts to: there's only one way to scale, and it's our way, and so we're changing the protocol now, even though we have no code to show, and even though the benefits of this change are probably years off.

Sorry, can't get on board with this.  It's like segwit all over again.
What's insane is that it's literally the same argument we used against Core when they tried to tell us that everyone had to run Core else the chain would split.  It's open source software FFS.  It's literally one line of code, and then a BTC Core client accepts an 8 MB block.  They acted as if, just because something ships with a default, that nobody could ever change it.  It's one goddamned line of code!!!

We explained this until we got kicked out of rbitcoin.

Just like we told Core in 2015: **all consensus is emergent.**

Right but you have no evidence that any of these represent any kind of fraud taking place.

As far as you know these are just people sending coins to themselves.

In fact that's more likely since nobody ever hears anyone complaining about having been double-spent against.

I'm not saying that nobody has ever fraudulently performed a double-spend on BCH.  It definitely could have happened.  What I'm saying is that without further information, this site is in no way evidence of any kind of fraud or even an actual problem of any kind ever taking place.

I think one of the key failures of BTC was the collapse onto a single client. Mike tried to fix that with XT which was successfully framed as an "attack on Bitcoin." BCH "fixed" the problem by claiming decentralized teams. But it doesn't matter if you have decentralized teams if nobody uses their clients.

The network is more fragile when everyone runs the same code.
>LN is opt in.  

LN is the alpha and omega of BTC scaling.

LN is all you got, actually.

It reduces the network's ability to scale by over 1/2.

Yes, it's that bad.

1. One guy controls 50%+ of the hashpower. Same guy is crazy as fuck and has claimed he will steal funds from users and or blacklist addresses. No I'm not making this up. 

2. The client exists to thwart the very reason we created BCH - to get to massive onchain scaling. Raising the block size is merely a dog whistle. 
1. Why do you need to run your own node to validate everyone's transactions when all your transactions are actually on the Lightning Network where nobody can validate them?

2. If Lightning Network is actually not exclusive to Bitcoin but actually commingles funds from all sorts of cryptos, including "USD" coins  which can be printed just like USD, what prevents dilution and crowding-out (nobody transacts using BTC on LN because other coins are always more liquid)

3. If BTC is good because it guarantees that you'll always be able to run a full node on minimum hardware, and if an onchain transaction is required to open a Lightning channel, doesn't that mean that chains like BCH will dominate Lightning Network since the order-of-magnitude greater onchain capacity means that it can onboard new users at over 10x the rate (currently, more in future) than BTC (BTC can only onboard ~7 people per sec, max, whereas 32MB BCH can currently on onboard 100 new users per sec)

4. Jimmy Song claims to be a developer. Where can we find his code contributions?  He claims to be an educator. Where can we find his education credentials?

You're welcome.

 As you can see, a soft fork is a *coercive* fork: the miners agree to cause the fork, and the users have no self-defense against the change. Since users cannot concede to the change, a soft fork can cause a loss of consensus.

Now let's compare to a hard fork.

If miners implement a hard fork, then your coins only receive the "upgrade" if you concede. Since the change only impacts  users who concede to the change, it is not coercive. If enough people refuse the change, then the change may be prevented or the coin may be split into two versions, each of which is better suited to its constituency.

Soft forks are a coercive change to your money.

Hard forks are an opt-in change to your money.

You tell me which is better.

Now ask yourself, if it really works this way, why the other side was so insistent on implementing segwit as a soft fork.

Isn't it awesome that you get to shitpost in our uncensored sub?
You forgot how Segwit instantly cuts the network's capacity in half.

Since I know I'll get attacked again for pointing this out, I'll offer a terse explanation.

A while back some quality research was done and it was determined at that time that the [network could safely upgrade to 4MB payloads](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4cqbs8/cornell_study_recommends_4mb_blocksize_for_bitcoin). For the sake of argument let's assume that's still the case.

That means we can safely upgrade to SW which permits payloads up to 4MB, but not SW2X because it permits payloads up to 8MB. Consensus will reject this as too risky: the whole point of the limit is to prevent the risk of "too big" blocks.

We could also upgrade to a 4MB block size limit without Segwit.

With Segwit we expect to see *up to* ~1.7-2MB payloads under normal use.  It's possible to build larger Segwit payloads, but we would only expect to see these in unusual "attack" situations.  Under normal use, Segwit maxes out at around a 1.7-2x throughput bump, or up to ~6 tps.

Without Segwit we can expect to see *up to* 4MB payloads under normal use, or up to ~12 tps.

So for a given safe network upgrade limit, say 4MB, the network can get 6 tps with Segwit or 12 tps of capacity without Segwit.

They call that "scaling?"

O_o that isn't scaling that's a poison pill!

Another way to look at it is that a 2MB *nonsegwit* payload gives you up to 2MB of expected capacity with a max 2MB attack block footprint; with Segwit, you get up to 2MB of expected capacity with a max 4MB attack block footprint.

Segwit is anti-onchain-scaling. It literally moves us backward.

Edit: I rounded up the Segwit numbers just to give it all of the benefit of doubt.

**Edit: this needs to be hammered home before the network takes the pill! Time is running out!!**
Isn't it great that you can post this here and it doesn't get deleted even though it's total bullshit?
Bitcoin has the promise of being upgradeable, censorship resistant, and immune to capture. 

What you are watching is an attempt by a special interest group to block upgrades, censor small transactions, and capture the tech. This is Bitcoin's trial by fire. If it succeeds, anyone holding Bitcoin will be amazingly rich. 

Edit: downvoted immediately to -1 
> As an aside, I haven't personally spoken to anyone (in person) who thinks that SegWit2MB is a good proposal. You end up with the worst of both worlds: hacky-soft-fork-segwit and all of the complications that come with executing a hard fork on a 7+ year network, with a small throughput bump that will give us another ~12 months of headroom (I'm being optimistic).

...*and what's worse* this leaves the entrenched power-players in control of a rigid block size limit.
What a lying crock of shit.  Changing the pre-Segwit code to support 2 MB blocks is literally a one-line of code change.  Instead they change over 4000 lines of code to create Segwit, then say that a 2 MB hardfork is too time consuming.

And why on Earth does Adam Back, who does not even contribute code, even have a voice in this?

be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and
decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be
publicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the
order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the
majority of nodes **agreed it was the first received.**

Tl;dw helmets are okay if by choice, but if mandated people stop riding and sit in cars, which is bad for health, environment, and expenses, so don’t mandate.

Also in their, perceived safety with a helmet increases a lot, so people take dumber risks, cars don’t respect cyclists space, and overall, non-helmet wearing areas have less injuries due to better infrastructure and respecting the road. Also, cycling is about as dangerous as walking, and cars kill a lot of people.

Helmets visually appear to be safe, but statistically don’t do much except discourage cycling

Hahaha that's awesome.  What will be the major advances in SSD, fiber and multiprocessor technology in 2022-24? I'm dying to hear your insights.

Anyone who has ever worked in IT management knows that when a Dev tells you "18 months" what he's really saying is, "we have no earthly idea if or when this will be finished."
Nailed it. Complete with BTG going tits-up.
By my definition of "microtransaction" it is impossible to efficiently perform an onchain microtransaction, because I define it to mean "a transaction too small to be efficiently handled."

So on BTC it may be that $5 is a microtransaction whereas on BCH the threshold is closer to $0.50.

When you see it this way you realize that "layer 2" systems for (microtransactions like Lightning) are useful in any coin, since they can enable classes of transactions that can't be efficiently processed onchain; but you also can start to see that the better the onchain experience, the less there is a need for layer 2 systems.

.... then he wakes up and immediately switches back to talking about GOLD and spends another seven years bashing this idea of CASH and a bunch of other shit he said when he was apparently having a complete dissociative fugue as "Satoshi."

The problem is that once there's "proof" it's waaaay too late to GTFO ifyaknowhutimean.

> quality wins the race

Yes, here I agree.

Moreover, quality is more than engineering.  **[Total quality](http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/total-quality-management/overview/overview.html) includes a *quality message* that truly satisfies the target market.**

A coin with *total quality* will have an [elevator pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch) that's ultra-compelling, because *total quality* understands the customer's (users, holders) needs and solves the customer's problems perfectly.

We have the engineering already.  We are facing an upcoming media event that is not within our control.

\^ this.  If you don't like the proposed EDA, code a better one and convince the majority of miners to run it.  Isn't that how this is supposed to work?
2X is better than 1X but it's an incremental improvement that has been wildly oversold.  Most of the people and politics stay more or less the same.

Bitcoin Cash gets rid of Segwit, RBF, and the Core legacy; increases blocks to 8MB where they belong, brings back ultra-fast 0-conf, and decentralizes development (4 teams).

In a strange way 2X is a compromise that helps nobody.  While I think it's counterproductive to have a coin with a 1MB limit, I can at least agree it's a novelty that gives certain differentiating attributes to the coin.  If you're for bigger blocks (I am) then why 2X, when you can have 8X, *and* no Segwit?
In general, the adoption of any complex piece of code in an already-complex software project is a power transfer to the developer who wrote and will maintain that particular code.
Bitcoin Cash not affected
That's kind of how I see it too.

I mean, either stick to the concept of ultra-limited capacity as a thing to be desired in and of itself or as a means to some particular end (ie entire blockchain on a smartwatch or smart toaster) -- or realize that there is a whole world of onchain scaling to be explored and optimizing/maximizing onchain transactions becomes the goal.

What need for Segwit then?  Segwit as a capacity increase is negligible and as a malleability fix it's hamfisted.  It was incorrectly marketed as a fork-free upgrade, a prediction so wrong it essentially spawned Bitcoin Cash as an antibody.  We were told we needed Segwit to get Lightning, in reality Lightning isn't anywhere near ready and doesn't actually require Segwit per se anyway.

With Bitcoin Cash we have 8MB blocks of 25+tps with emergent consensus upgrades to 32MB / 100tps at the ready.  We have zero-conf and low fees, plus decentralized development teams.
Disagree in the strongest possible terms. 

The devs of BCH are clearly more competent than their counterparts, who declared for years that a contentious hard fork wasn't even possible (it was) that it would permanently break Bitcoin (it didn't), that it would lead to a breakdown of the 21M coin limit (it didn't), that blocks >1 MB were inherently unsafe (they aren't), that soft-forks are better for the community than hard forks (they're worse), that LN would be ready in April 2016 (LOL!!), that SW was a meaningful capacity increase (it's not), that RBF was a good idea (it's not), that Bitcoin *needs higher fees* (are you kidding), that SPV is broken and doesn't work (insane), that every user needs to run a full node (whaaaat?), UASF (!!!) (complete with hats and swords), etc. etc. etc..

If you consider the amount of completely and utterly wrong, dumb, and outright insane things that the BTC Core devs have said and done over the years it's obvious that such levels of total dead-headed-wrongness could only be propped up and nurtured in an environment of bullying and censorship, which is how the lead devs have maintained control.

The brand follows that group because they co-oped the online spaces (bitcoin.org, rbitcoin, bitcointalk) and use these online spaces to spread propaganda and disinformation, not because of any sort of meritocracy of ideas.  If their ideas were meritocratic there would be no need to censor contrary information.

For once I agree with you foocoin!  I think you're starting to see the light.

Satoshi *did* intend for onchain Bitcoin to be used for *small, casual transactions.*

And that, my friend, right there, is you proving to all of us that Satoshi planned, expected, and essentially wrote into the white paper that blocks would grow large over time, and that's OK.

Keep posting here in our uncensored forum!
Then why was more hashpower signaling BU than Segwit prior to your agreement?
**LOL**

pwned
What you are witnessing is the living proof that Bitcoin needs no block size limit.

Adding an additional transaction to a block increases orphan risk. No miner wants his blocks orphaned. As a result, it can be profitable to exclude transactions, in order to ensure faster block propagation.

One strategy that sometimes occurs is that a miner gets lucky and finds two blocks in a row. Sometimes that miner will build the second block empty, just to push it out there and collect the reward.

While it would be nice to get more transactions in the block, the empty / not-full blocks add to the proof of work required to double spend the transactions buried under the work & add security to the blockchain.

The fact that more-full blocks = more orphan risk is exactly why it is safe to remove the block size limit. Bitcoin should be allowed to run at its economically efficient throughput: that level at which marginal transactions = marginal orphan risk.
Yeah but they're bitching about *everyone else's* kids...
32X capacity means that 32X more people can adopt BCH than BTC before fees become an issue. And that's assuming BCH never increases the block size further. When we have 100MB blocks it means that 100X more people can adopt BCH than BTC. When we have 1GB blocks then 1000X more people can adopt BCH than BTC. Etc.

Hope that helps.

Happened to BTC why not BCH? 
The obvious answer is that both ABC and nChain are playing chicken, and whichever one decides to remove the forced-forking features at the last minute will pool their hashpower and economic support from BU and other "nofork" supporters, and leave the other team hanging in the wind.  Here nchain has the advantage.

For example if nChain's hashpower soft-forks a restriction against mining the new opcodes and imposes a 32MB soft limit then ABC is off in its own world, and BSV, BU, XT, and Flowee users are in consensus.

ABC won't be able to do that because CTOR will be required by all its clients.

do you think Blockstream would be the same if they were heavily invested in BTC mining?

you seem confused here.

Edit: hijacking my own post, since it got a lot of upvotes.  Also, what's the biggest problem with LN?   Routing.  What solves routing?  A big fat hub right in the middle that most everyone connects to...  the idea that LN self-organizes without big centralized hubs is fantasy I think...
> We could've had Bitcoin Unlimited's Emergent Consensus with Flexible Transactions instead which would've solved this scaling "debate" once and for all. Now we will have to keep arguing every time the base blocksize needs its next upgrade.

We can still, if we're willing to find miners to mine and protect a fork before Segwit is irrevocably made part of the landscape.  The engineering work is largely understood, Ethereum showed the way, much of the code is already written, AFAIK.   Ask /u/freetrade or /u/ftrader.

They are asking the community to accept SW [+2MB *on faith*] - SW is bad engineering with questionable economics that leaves the block size limit in the political control of its current curators, which have done so much harm and showed so much ill-will to the community that I for one don't doubt for a minute that they will show bad faith on 2MB - *they already did this agreement before, remember?*

The community deserves the opportunity to decide once and for all if it wants to go along with this.  There should be a fork.  There should be choice.
There is better-than-circumstantial evidence that neither Adam nor Greg believed Bitcoin could stand up and run based on their reading of the code. 

What seems to be missing is a clear description of what it was that changed for them when they ostensibly started to believe it could work.  What misconceptions did they have previously that kept them away?  What facts changed those preconceptions?
Technology is coming along nicely.  It's the decentralized routing thing that isn't going to happen.

All you have to do is decide that placing your funds into trusted contracts with hubs that can tie up your funds is OK - then the thing works fine.  This idea that people are going to place funds into individually-maintained decentralized always-online Lightning hubs at coffeeshops and nail salons is the biggest lie of them all though.  The thing needs hubs in data centers because they need to be secure and available.  And it needs thousands of them to be remotely as decentralized as Bitcoin already is.

Well fuck, if it's OK to entrust our money to thousands of LN hubs in data centers, then let's just call them "nodes" and scale onchain shall we?
I can find no reference in the white paper to the concept of "mutability" or "immutability" or why this strange notion of "immutability" (not just of transactions, but of features, capabilities, and capacity) would be desired vis-a-vis *upgradeable money* which is *my* vision of Bitcoin.

These people have an agenda to change Bitcoin from what was originally proposed into something very different - not P2P cash, but P2P gold, something only megawhales and banks can play with.  If you accept that Bitcoin is "digital gold" then you might be tricked into thinking that the marginal onchain transaction cost therefore is the cost to expedite physical gold from point to point overnight or faster - theoretically $100s per transaction.

They should change POW and fork off from the Bitcoin project and spin off BitGold.

Gee it's almost as if all he wanted was a convenient excuse to say he no longer supported BCH. Who could have guessed? 
exactly
"lock down the protocol" is a core talking point. Unsurprisingly CSW and his NPCs are now repeating it. 
Jonald your article unfortunately didn't help alleviate my concerns.

In [his article explaining why ABC is moving to CTOR](https://medium.com/@Bitcoin_ABC/sharding-bitcoin-cash-35d46b55ecfb), Shammah Chancellor explains that the goal is "sharding" the validation task. In that article he claims that sharding is "the only way to scale" and that CTOR is the only, or at least best way to get there. I found these statements disconcerting.

Now, your article basically says, to summarize, "don't worry about CTOR because it isn't that scary, and won't hurt us." But you don't even touch on *why* CTOR is needed, or why it's needed *now* -- when "sharding" clients are still years away, according to Shammah, and when we have a disruptive entity *also* pushing other, incompatible changes that must be dealt with, and CTOR effectively splits the resistance to that other set of changes.

Where I come from, when you want to reengineer a thing to get a benefit, you must at least have a working prototype of the end goal before embarking on reengineering, to at least demonstrate that the end goal is conceivably achievable. 

Think how much better we all would be if the community had demanded a working Lightning Network prototype before embarking on reengineering BTC with Segwit, "the only way to scale" they said.

And please consider the impact that these changes have on the November upgrade, when what many people really want to see is the disruptive entity fall on his face. If CTOR was intended to disrupt that person's opposition it could hardly be more effective.
>You could say the same about any part of the network. You have to trust the node to relay your tx.

No, we've been here before. I don't have to trust any particular node to relay the txn because the funds are not locked into a contract with a particular node, as they are with Lightning.  

> You have to trust the miner to include it.

No, I have to trust that at least ONE miner in the entire network of miners will include it. My funds are not locked into a contract with a particular miner.

> With spv you have to trust that you are not lied to by omission. 

No, I do not, because I can poll any number of nodes until I am satisfied that I am getting the truthful chain.

Your understanding of how Bitcoin works is, frankly, pathetic.
>What a ridiculous argument. By this logic, if CSW were to provide proof that he is Satoshi, he would have more right to the BCH ticker

Naw man. He would have the right to the **BTC** ticker, and moreover he could assert ownership of all derived PoW blockchain products - more or less, every blockchain coin ever produced. 

This line of reasoning is utterly bizarre. I think jtoomim is tripping on his brother's acid. This is the same guy that launched Bitcoin Classic, now he's arguing that he couldn't have legally done that, since it would usurp Cores "ownership" of BTC. My head is spinning.
That's right: if there's a sustained coinsplit, and Jihan is against one side of the fork, he can dump it into oblivion
Very well said, sir.

Nope, nor a Christian, just a stickler for language and context.
Run a node from 2010 and it will sync no chain.  OHNOES Bitcoin doesn't exist.
I've been maybe one of the most outspoken critics of non-cash use cases of BCH and tokenization in general.  It's Bitcoin **CASH** FFS, amirite?

However.  If there's going to be a "non-cash" use case of the blockchain, then I'd say "uncensorable Twitter" is a pretty fucking awesome thing to build.  Beats fuck-all out of cryptokitties and get-rich-quick ICOs.

That said, we had "uncensorable Twitter" 30 years ago in the form of Usenet, and we know how it turned out.

Also AFAIK memo.cash is still a centralized hosted application.  What we need, is decentralized end-user clients that don't need a host.

Also also: memo.cash isn't just Twitter.  It's also Facebook, if you want it to be.

Edit: just read the AntPool announcement regarding their decision to burn BCH.

> The Bitcoin Cash community should embrace the entrepreneurial spirit and treat any fee paying transaction as a customer. Even if those transactions are non-BCH tokens, and even if those transactions are not about the transfer of money.

Looks like this ship is sailing whether I'm on it or not...
Hi /u/Cobra-Bitcoin

The "niche" market for cash equivalents ($100T) is approximately 15x greater than the market for illiquid gold equivalents ($7T).

BTC is designing for the niche market.  BCH is targeting the mass market.
[Then something changed....](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/z/dl8v4lp)
I urge you to reconsider your opinion of that thread.  Your response is not constructive.  Suggestion: "the great thing about Bitcoin.com is that we take security so seriously, *even though we don't think this is a likely attack vector, we've logged your suggestion for improvement and will take it very seriously.*"
I agree it looks that way, but the actual problem is with coin.dance. It needs updating. It's not using the right magic and can't see the network.
Frankly in many ways BU or XT is the superior product. ABC was the miner choice at fork-time because it was a "minimal viable fork", while BU was more complex and would have been harder to coordinate. But BU has great devs with a longer history and good science backing their work.  And XT is the oldest, most established altclient.

What I'd really like to do is "walk our talk."  I'd like to see one of these teams take the lead (nominally) on the May fork. I'd like to use May as an opportunity to showcase BU or XT and highlight the fact that no team is the boss of Bitcoin Cash.
Thanks, this proves the point perfectly.

"I dare you to prove you can double-spend on BCH" = removed

gild /u/tippr
You raise an important point and he did a bad job of making his case.

You are absolutely correct that the capital represented by an unconfirmed transaction in the mempool exists in a limbo state until it's confirmed or rejected.  It's no longer controlled by either the sender or the receiver for the duration of the zero-conf, and only becomes "working capital" after it has some confirms.

A Lightning channel makes that limbo state (semi)permanent. When you lock money in a Lightning channel, it's no different than any other sort of sidechain: your capital is effectively removed from the first layer and flows into the second layer. The capital in a Lightning Network is no longer represented on the chain and doesn't reappear onchain until the Lightning Network is closed.

The reason people say "LN isn't Bitcoin" is because the chain is the authoritative system of record, and LN removes your capital from the authoritative system of record and displaces it into an ephemeral system.
>Because ETH has ... low fees

Incorrect.  This is a common misconception about Ethereum.

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html

But then, Ethereum isn't designed to be currency. Its current ability to be useful as a currency is primarily due to the fact that it's only now just starting to be used for its actual purpose, which is executing smart contracts and uncensorable applications.  When it is used for these applications and it is executing complex smart contracts on a regular basis, we can expect *much* higher fees for "P2P Cash" type transactions.
"If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry."
at this point Bitcoin is attacking itself

Be sure to implement segwit. With your small block sizes, you'll out-Core Core.
Good answer but let's correct one error

> To make a block you need to guess a number, do math on it, and get a result that is a sufficiently low number.  When more people are guessing, it becomes ~~alot easier to happen to get a sufficiently low number.~~ likely that one of them will guess the number quickly.

when there are more people guessing at the number, it doesn't make the problem easier.  It makes it more likely that one of the guessers will guess correctly in under 10 minutes.  when that happens, the number is made harder to guess, to try to keep the rate of guessing at around 10 minutes.

the rest of your explanation is excellent
BTC suffered from a fatally flawed organizational design that left it wide open to capture: the idea of a central team in charge of a central repo used as a "reference client."  That made an investment in BTC simply an investment in that team, like investing in Apple or Microsoft etc.

BCH has fixed this fundamental flaw by eliminating the notion of a "reference client" from our organizational design.  With no Hallowed Team In Charge, an investment in BCH is an investment in a much larger ecosystem of solutions.

This is what I thought would happen originally with BTC but I underestimated the ease with which the community would accept wholesale attacks on the community and a giant reengineering / vaporwareitization of the entire project.  We always knew that one day someone would try to "jam up" the project, we just underestimated how well that would play out.
Of course I do, but I don't understand why you're discussing a zcash spin off:

Moore's Law + code optimizations

The beauty of Bitcoin is that the number of relay/validation servers (aka "full nodes") needed to operate the network and keep it decentralized is not large.  Past this point, adding more relays provides diminishing returns.  So Bitcoin can scale to any size userbase without dramatically increasing the number of full nodes.  While the ratio of fullnodes/users will drop that ratio is not important.  What's important is that there is "sufficient" redundancy and enough capacity to serve the userbase.  That's it.
I actually agree with a lot that you wrote here, and your argument is reasonable so have my upvote.

However I don't agree with you on one major point and that's this: you are approaching the entire argument from the point of view of an average person in a first world country with a viable currency.  In these places, you are correct: there is no general need for cryptocurrency except as a speculation.

That's a myopic view.  The bigger picture is that it is only a matter of time before a people with reasonably viable infrastructure but a typical kleptocratic regime adopts a cryptocurrency for day to day use. There are developed places in the world like Greece, Italy, Malta, Catalonia, and many smaller Asian states, where, with just the right product and timing, we could see a crypto economy begin to develop. Not people storing wealth away, but a true closed-loop economy where people get paid and spend in a decentralized crypto.

And that will be the **real** moon moment.

I don't know if Bitcoin Cash will be the one they adopt but it damn sure won't be legacy Bitcoin.
It very well might.  It appears that there is an awful lot of money being used to push Segwit, have you seen Bitcoin price?  Who's to say how high these supporters might be willing to pump the price of your coin?  Lower-cap altcoins are especially prone to price manipulation.
>> They want Bitcoin to be crippled so that off-chain, non-Bitcoin solutions can put Bitcoin in the hands of bankers like AXA

> This is just stupid. They just disagree about block size

Erik get real.

No serious technologist believes that there is any reason whatsoever to limit blocks to 1MB/10mins when a billion people have *fucking telephones* that can download 1MB/sec and another hundred million or so have home internet that runs at 100MB/sec synchronous and disk space is $70/TB and typical users don't even need the goddamn chain to begin with.

Just.  Stop.
Great comment.  /u/tippr tip .01 bcc

Here's a great example.

Alice sends 1 btc to Bob

Bob sends 1 btc to Charlie

Charlie sends 1 btc to Dave

...

Zelda completes the loop and sends 1 btc to Alice

Now everyone settles.

Guess what.  There was 26 btc worth of economic activity, and zero funds were moved onchain.  The net to miners is *zero.* . For a more extreme example imagine the loop above was completed 100 times before settling.  2600 btc worth of economy, nothing for miners to do.

The more Lightning is adopted, the worse this problem will become, because there will be less and less "leakage" from LN back onchain.

When you move economic activity offchain, the security of the system that underlies all of it is directly harmed.

Welcome!  SO.... as you're probably aware, this sub was created out of a necessity since many people were being forcibly ejected from rbitcoin and we needed a place to discuss.  If you're aren't familiar, read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/z/dl8v4lp) because it's worth your while.

needless to say there's a level of anger and hostility here because many of us are long time Bitcoiners who feel as though the project has been coopted by devs with a very different agenda from the bitcoin white paper and we don't like being treated like lepers for our beliefs in this regard.
 
these devs claim to have a plurality of "dev opinion" behind them but this is poppycock:

* many talented devs who disagreed with the Core team left or were kicked out

* many more never contributed but went on to work on other cryptocurrencies entirely, feeling that Bitcoin politics were insurmountable

* you'll not find another major crypto where capacity has been deliberately constrained in order to limit use and drive up fees - this is the unconscionable act -  which objecting to caused us to be ejected from the community

Some of us can be a bit harsh and we don't purport to have all the answers but what we do agree on 100% is that onchain capacity needs to be as plentiful as feasibly possible, and limits set by market incentives, not neckbeards.

AS for Lightning and other "L2" solutions I think you'll find we're suspicious and cautious.  The thing is: Bitcoin is permissionless, so if someone builds a Lightning Network that *really works* then people will just adopt it out of market force and frankly I think most of us agree that means it probably is a good thing.

In the meantime, I think people on this sub agree that we need to make Bitcoin as accessible as possible to everyone who wants to own their own Bitcoin -- which means putting it in a wallet whose keys they exclusively control -- which means making an onchain transaction.  This will still be true even if Lightning Network is finished to spec, since every Lightning channel requires an onchain transaction to open, close, or top-up, Lightning will work *better* on a bigger-block chain.

Glad to see you around.    
Lightning Network cannot function properly with always-full blocks, because it makes channel closure and antifraud unpredictable.

Here's the great bit: Segwit essentially halves total network capacity.  If the network aggregate can support a max of 8MB payloads, then we can support SW2X (8MB max) with ~10tps throughput, or 8MB largerblocks with ~24tps throughput.

**Lightning Network will *work better* without Segwit.**
> I find the whole idea of there even being a "lead maintainer of bitcoin" to be just horrible

**ACK**
>> please explain why a penny-apiece transaction needs Bitcoin security and isn't sufficiently secure on the #2 blockchain whatever that is today

> It does't.

So where's the demand then?  Why aren't Ethereum and Monero and Dash and Litecoin flooded with penny onchain transactions, since the full security of Bitcoin isn't needed?  Moreover, with near-infinite demand, where were all these transactions in the seven years of Bitcoin prior to 2016?

> I said 'if' you could get the full security of the bitcoin blockchain for pennies apiece, people would use it. Obviously, things are not in that state now.

No, you said there was a "near infinite" demand for these transactions.  I've heard that trope for over a year now.  It's false.

I'm pointing out that you have fallen for a story that has no basis in reality, and are using this story as the basis for bad policy.

We have - only now, after 8 years - filled 1MB blocks.  If we doubled today to 2MB, once the backlog cleared, we'd start running ~1.1MB blocks.  Not 2MB.

> I said 'if' you could get the full security of the bitcoin blockchain for pennies apiece, **people would use it.**

Yes, that was what Satoshi promised us, and why we holders have been paying with inflation for years now to subsidize mining.  I wanted people to use Bitcoin, so I accepted the inflation.  We're still paying - with inflation - over $10K ever 10 minutes to subsidize mining, on the expectation that, **thanks to the subsidy, there will be plenty of capacity for cheap secure transactions to bootstrap adoption.**

That's what we signed up for.  Not this "fee market" nonsense to prevent a hypothetical problem 120+ years in the future.
>But the gigablock testnet hasn't been demonstrated to anyone yet. It was merely a lab experiment done in artificial unrealistic conditions and published in an academic paper. 

Well it highlighted real bottlenecks in the code that needed to be addressed and demonstrated that if these bottlenecks were addressed that the system could scale on reasonable hardware. Yes, in lab conditions.

If someone wants to infiltrate and gain trust of big block community they're going to have to pose as a big blocker. 

Sorry but these points at least carry zero evidentiary weight for me.
The biggest lie they sold was the lie that you had to choose between "digital gold" and "digital cash."  That you had to choose between "store of value" and "medium of exchange."

whynotboth.gif

The *promise* of Bitcoin was that it was like **digital gold you could teleport nearly instantly and nearly for free.**  That was the value proposition!

I'd like to think that if this is a tribe, that what defines our tribe is that we're the ones who think things like xthinner and blocktorrent are among the most important things we can be working on.
Smaller blocks lead to higher fees, which will lead to the reduction of users/use cases, which reduces decentralization, which decreases the security of Bitcoin BTC, which makes Bitcoin less safe.

>Trolls have been going on about how BCH can be attacked for some ridiculously low amount like $2000 or whatever. A billionaire threw millions per day at attacking BCH and failed to even reverse a single transaction.

This part needs to be driven home again and again. In fact you're being modest.

This douchebag billionaire *first* said that he was going to commandeer the BCH rule set with his overwhelming hashpower. He went on to say that if he couldn't do that, then he would effectively shut down BCH. "Two years, no trade" was the party line IIRC.

And then as you rightly point out, after spending tens of millions of dollars, *failed to even reverse a single BCH transaction,* at a time when BCH was hitting all time lows and therefore security was at a minimum.

I really don't think the market has digested what this means. At all.

Heh. It took a whopping **2 secs** to find a route for only $0.30 on a completely uncongested network. This is fine. 
Some of us believe the same entity funding Calvin's attack on BCH is also funding other attacks.

Recall CSW claimed they would take down not just BCH but all the altcoins too. Maybe since Plan A backfired they've moved to Plan B. 
But adoption, onchain scaling, and privacy are so boring compared to salty personal attacks and raving lunatics threatening to blow up the entire cryptosphere with their fake coins.
Ryan specifically said that the ABC side had a duty to reorg the BSV side.  Others in that camp have called it a moral imperative.

This is an interesting observation and I'm inclined to agree with it.

In this context, a contentious hard fork is actually a kind of waste elimination process. 
One post you support BSV, the next post you support Core.  Sometimes you blend 'em up.

Please, do continue to remind us how Core and BSV share a common goal.

But no: unlike the definition of a coin as a specific form of digital signature chain (broken by Segwit) the DAA isn't mentioned in the white paper, which is why it was OK for us to upgrade it.  But BSV claims to want to go back to the way the protocol was originally *implemented* in the v1 Satoshi client.  So, they're going to need to revert the DAA unless they're just talking out of their collective asses.  Probably the biggest change that we've made to the original protocol is the DAA.
Where can I post a bounty? I've got a BCH for whoever wants to port the stress test tool to BSV.

This is not true.  BCH does not have a reference client.

ABC only has a [~2/3 majority to BU nodes](https://cash.coin.dance/nodes), unlike Core's [~95% majority](https://coin.dance/nodes) and defacto reference client position.

BU and other devs take a lead on various client improvements.  The protocol "ownership" in BCH is decentralized.

You are absolutely correct that the 96 Telecom bill was mostly about the nascent Internet and the breakup of the bell network and not just radio. I'm talking more specifically about its applicability to radio.

While it is true that consumers have a lot more choices, at least as of two years ago, broadcast radio was *still* the #1 form of new music discovery, with word of mouth being #2, meaning you were still very likely to discover new music from radio or from someone else who discovered it there.  Radio is still hugely important to music discovery... And we can all agree it's become hugely politically important, particularly since 1996. Hmmmm.

The radio industry was previously greatly shaped by the 1934 Communications act. In 1934, most of the USA got its news from print, and most print content was owned by one man: William Randolph Hearst.  Congress did not want to see the nascent radio business instantly collapse into monopoly or oligopoly because it had seen the effect of Hearst's politically biased "yellow journalism" on the country and feared a similar effect with radio.  So they established legal regulations to prevent airwave monopolization.  Hindsight may have proven their case.

For sixty years, radio in the USA was largely local and decentralized as a result, and I will opine - just my opinion - that it was a strictly superior product to the radio of today in all ways except economic efficiency. Deregulation has allowed profit maximization at the expense of local access and diversity and it has made radio every bit as politically toxic as print was in Hearst's day.  Just my opinion.

Even if you don't share my opinion, this is still a very important topic to deep-dive on, because radio represents a real life case study in the consequences of changing from a radically decentralized to radically centralized economy.   It's a good topic to study, regardless.
This is a great idea. But maybe not Roger, but some pro-bch organization.
Agree entirely.
There are leaders and there are followers.

When leaders do their leadership thing it tends to piss off followers.

Amaury is brash and AFAIU hard to work with.  This is typical of leadership personalities.   Also of highly intelligent people.

The number is millions not thousands.

Since the effect is additional deflation which helps everyone else, freezing small wallets due to high fees is literally no different than confiscating the wallets of poor people and giving the money to the rich.
I disagree. LN needs guinea pigs to find the bugs and to determine if the proposed incentives really work. BTC has bet the farm on this technology, now isn't the time to get cold feet. "Fail fast" as they say. Everyone should download LN and give it a fair open minded shot.
This exactly. Once you fully abstract the notion of "capital" off L1 and onto L2 then you can be agnostic about L1, it really doesn't matter anymore.

Why run a node if you can't use the coin?
> Core claim that the reason bitcoin cash has low fee is because of low usage. 

Easily disproven. [BCH is processing larger blocks at this moment than Bitcoin Core](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin%20cash-size.html) and fees are still around a penny or less per txn for a typical txn.

Argument falls down on first inspection.
Yeah, that's for SSDs, which aren't at all necessary for a 1MB blockchain which has 2009-class bandwidth requirements.

Mass storage is typically quoted at $0.05/GB these days which is what I used as the reference price for my title, or $7.50 to store the blockchain.   Even at $0.10/GB for retail HDDs, that's $15 to store the blockchain.

This is becoming cheaper than the new transaction fee norm.

WTF indeed.

Lightning transactions are all unconfirmed transactions that rely on your ability to maintain your coins in a secure, ~~always-on~~ bitcoin node which must be connected to the internet without getting hacked.

That is really all you need to understand in order to grasp how they are much less secure than onchain transactions.

This is not to say there isn't a purpose for Lightning Network. But when someone tells you "Lightning transactions *are* Bitcoin transactions" then you will understand that they are trying to manipulate you. 
> Hard forks shouldnt happen and usually aren't profitable for both parties

This is the fundamental problematic misunderstanding that needs to be corrected.

Party A wants black for its heat absorbing properties. Party B wants white for its heat reflecting properties. They are both fighting against gray, the compromise solution that they are both suffering under.

Someone invents a way for people to split their gray into equal parts black and white.

Q: Which party is made worse off?

A: Neither. All parties are made better off.

When a community is fundamentally divided about a choice that presents mutually exclusive possibilities, then a split is not only inevitable, but it makes all holders better off.

Group A wants restricted onchain scaling.

Group B wants to maximize onchain scaling.

There is no compromise here. The better off A is, the worse off B is; and vice-versa. By splitting, everyone who believes in restricting onchain scaling can now realize their vision of Bitcoin unencumbered by group B; and everyone who believes in maximizing onchain scaling can realize their vision of Bitcoin unencumbered by group A.

This is win-win for all parties. We would expect the sum total of the split coin to be decidedly higher than that of the unified presplit coin.

The greater the controversy, the greater the expected appreciation in value resulting from the split.   
Two answers.

Yes, this is exactly why the nonsense about hardforks destroying the community is total bullshit.

If you think BCC is a scamcoin, then look - just sell yours today, and buy more BTC.  The only person stopping you, is you.

Hardforks are about economic optimization, freedom of choice, and noncoercion.  Today you are as rich in BCC as you were in BTC yesterday.  It's a gift to you by the developers and miners of BCC.  Do with it as you will.

Nobody comes out worse in a hardfork, except by his own choices.

Hi, "Blockstream" is a for-profit company, and it certainly has investors. 

Stay with us here.
UASF only harms its participants.

It helps everyone else.
Bitcoin is already "better money" than Ethereum - for now - because it has a heavier capitalization & more market liquidity, it is more widely accepted as money, it is available on more exchanges.  Ethereum is more portable (has faster, cheaper confirmations).  A block size increase will allow Bitcoin transactions to be price competitive again with Ethereum transactions.

At that point Ethereum would have faster confirmations, Bitcoin would be as-good or better in most other ways; Bitcoin would have also demonstrated that it can perform mainchain upgrades...  I'd say still, advantage Bitcoin.

This presumes that all of the capital doesn't flee first.

Edit: don't get me wrong - I like Ethereum and hold some, but think that there is a logic to "keep the money's featureset limited to 'what makes it money' - everything else is just an non-value-added attack vector."  Ideally, cryptos should be able to be frictionlessly converted from one to another, so capital should concentrate in the crypto that "does money best."

If you think I'm wrong, I'd love to hear why.  I'll sit back and listen (seriously)

Isn't it interesting how rapidly the troll narrative changed during / following the BSV attack?  One day it's an onslaught of "bcash btrash bcrash" from a handful of well known troll accounts. Then comes Faketoshi and with him a new brand of troll, one that supports everything nchain does, and likes the name BAB instead of bcash. Now the hashwar is over, well, it's back to the bcash trolls. 

It's *almost as if* the same people are behind both troll campaigns.

http://archive.is/gu2LS

> Around about the same time last year when Blockstream came active on the scene every single bitcoin troll disappeared, and I mean literally every single one. In the years before that there were a large number of active anti-bitcoin trolls. They even have an active sub r/buttcoin. Up until last year you could go down to the bottom of pretty much any thread in r/bitcoin and see many of the usual trolls who were heavily downvoted for saying something along the lines of "bitcoin is shit", "You guys and your tulips" etc. But suddenly last year they all disappeared. Instead a new type of bitcoin user appeared. Someone who said they were fully in support of bitcoin but they just so happened to support every single thing Blockstream and its employees said and did. They had the exact same tone as the trolls who had disappeared. Their way to talking to people was aggressive, they'd call people names, they had a relatively poor understanding of how bitcoin fundamentally worked. They were extremely argumentative. These users are the majority of the list of that video. When the 10's of thousands of users were censored and expelled from r/bitcoin they ended up congregating in r/btc. The strange thing was that the users listed in that video also moved over to r/btc and spend all day everyday posting troll-like comments and misinformation. Naturally they get heavily downvoted by the real users in r/btc. They spend their time constantly causing as much drama as possible. At every opportunity they scream about "censorship" in r/btc while they are happy about the censorship in r/bitcoin. These people are astroturfers. What someone somewhere worked out, is that all you have to do to take down a community is say that you are on their side. It is an astoundingly effective form of psychological attack.

Here's your post, which is generating great discussion, and which you say was downvoted to -6, but now it's +10.  Obviously, being downvoted did not silence you. You have your audience. You've reached people.

Had your comment been censored, like so much content is removed on rbitcoin, then we could not discuss it, and it could never reach +10.  It would just be gone, and nobody would even realize it was ever there, or that it was removed.
Most upvoted comment: use Litecoin

Openly promoting altcoin.

Not censored.
Exactly. I can accept people being wrong. This isn't that. This is being deliberately deceptive.
First off, Luke validates OP when he literally says the original design is "impossible." There you have it folks: BTC is Bitcoin for everyone who thinks Bitcoin is impossible.

In fact, fraud proofs are described in the white paper as "nice to haves" not "must haves." In fact, nobody has ever been defrauded because they were using SPV, *even though most users use SPV.*

*The only thing a full node protects you from is Nakamoto Consensus.*

Then, Luke is wrong here:

https://mobile.twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1003442357637959680

Wealth is generally distributed along something resembling a power-law curve, or steeper. Meaning, since a tiny number of entities constitute the vast majority of wealth, *your* full node doesn't matter.  Only a handful of economically relevant nodes need to validate the chain to keep it honest.

Furthermore, all *economically relevant* nodes can afford to run at almost any scale.
It's unnecessary from the point of view of "enforcing consensus against the miners" or "needing to validate your own occasional transactions."

There are perfectly good reasons to want to have a copy of the blockchain.  Perhaps you run a business that needs to integrate its systems with blockchain data, or you want to do some analytics, or you're a payment processor who serves millions of users, etc..
They fooled thousands, maybe millions of people.  A lot of really smart people fell for this.

Satoshi was correct!

> It is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid 
one.... The CPU power 
proof-of-work vote must have the final say. The only way for everyone to stay 
on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, 
no matter what.

Turns out I agree with that - always did - and by that argument, the BTC chain is definitely currently the valid Bitcoin chain.  No doubt about it.

The reason that I use their argument against them is that it now works against them when we say, "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin."  There is no question that by Satoshi's definition, the BTC chain is the valid Bitcoin chain.  But by the small-blocker / UASF definition, the individual determines validity based on his choice of client, which means that we can say "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin" with a straight face to them: we're demonstrating the ironic outcome of their own logic.

In reality, BTC is Bitcoin and BCH is Bitcoin Cash.

Now.

It's possible - some might say, likely - that Bitcoin Cash can significantly overtake BTC in hashpower.  Even for a while.

As it turns out, the BTC chain ain't built to roll like that, so if / when this happens, then BCH will be "Bitcoin" because the BTC chain may well die.
I could advance a technical / strategic argument for why BCH is better, but you'll likely hear this from others.

In the end, the factor that pushed me over into the BCH camp is the community.  The BTC online communities lean heavily on censorship and hamfisted moderation of anyone who persistently questions the party line, and a single, unknown person has had tremendous influence in removing these "undesirables" from the community.

Now, even if all the conspiracy theories are false, [groupthink is still a thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8e7yq7/this_btc_supporter_that_doesnt_even_know_who/).  If you see a community divided into "groupthinkers" who live mainly inside an information bubble that protects them from "bad ideas" and a more hetergeneous group of rivals that live mainly in uncensored space, betting against the groupthinkers, like the guy in the video, is the rational bet.  This person seems like a nice enough guy - but listening to him makes it very clear that his information sources have prevented him from learning what most people in this sub consider to be fundamental information, like "who is Gavin Andresen" or "to use Lightning Network, one must commit money to a channel with a channel partner, and monitor that channel for fraud."

Even if by chance the groupthinkers happen to start out with all the advantages - the best devs, the top brand recognition, market leadership, the most infrastructure - eventually such a society is doomed to failure.  The field of Organizational Development is rife with case study after case study about the toxicity of groupthink and how it dooms groups of all sorts.

rbtc wouldn't even exist except for the pro-groupthink strategy.  The very existence of BCH was set in motion [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/).  They literally built their own Frankenstein by their strategy.  Consider that...
So? The point of peer-to-peer electronic cash isn't to turn miners and holders into the banks of tomorrow, so that we're all having to use their permissioned, centralized routing network.
Best I can tell what's being attacked is one phrase he said in a live speech.

Barack Obama once said there were 57 states and people had a field day with this as if Barack Obama didn't know there are 50 states.  In reality of course Obama knows how many states there are and people attacking him for a flub just looked lame.

Same deal. This is a massive attack on a tongueflub.

Agreed. Most people getting into crypto haven't the foggiest idea what they're buying or why, but are simply purchasing a ticker symbol with the expectation of being able to sell that ticker symbol to someone even more ignorant than they are at some future point in time.

My post aims to wake these people up, if possible.

You guys should have forked off an altcoin if you wanted to turn Bitcoin from Cash into settlement for Lightning Network.
Rick, great video.  I think you get it 99.8% correct.  This is all stuff we've been saying here for two years now, but you've managed to distill it right down to the essence. Well done.

I do want to take 0.1% issue with this statement.

> Every single transaction invalidates the entire global routing table

This seems to imply that every transaction modifies the state of every channel. Instead, I might have put it like this:

> Every single transaction invalidates an arbitrary subset of the entire global routing table

Which is still awful, but not quite the same thing as "the entire table" from an engineering POV.
Wait what!?

SBI Group is *mining* Bitcoin Cash!?

On what hardware? Are they renting hashpower from you guys or mining on their own hardware?

If it's on their own hardware, this is quite possibly the biggest imaginable news short of a nation state adopting BCH.
Sounds like someone doesn't understand Bitcoin Cash's DAA.

Generally speaking, BCH's DAA means that BCH's mining ratio will always follow its price ratio.

Do we have any idea what the timeline would be for implementation?
It should be noted that the "timestamping" capability of the blockchain isn't perfect even with no "full blocks" policy.  Even if blocks are not full, various conditions might cause transactions to accumulate for a bit in the mempool.  There is no chronological ordering of transactions implied *within* a block, so resolution of > 10 mins is impossible.  Also, transactions that arrive "just in time" to make it into a block could have been created after other transactions that didn't happen to make it into that miner's mempool in time. 

In short the invention was never "perfect" to begin with; however, (A) a key utility it provides is timestamping within a range of resolution, and (B) the longer the backlog, the worse its utility as a timestamping server becomes.

> The only exception is if you are a merchant and want to accept unconfirmed transactions as payment.

and in fairness, most merchants already outsource all their payment processing anyway, so these merchants would never have been expected to want or need to run a "heavy / full" node anyway.  The kind of merchants that would do their own in-house payment processing are companies like Amazon or Wal-Mart for whom storing and validating the blockchain will always be trivial at any scale.

**If you are too lazy to upgrade your "full node" then you absolutely positively should not be running such a device, any more than you should run a mail or web server without staying on top of updates and patches.**  You are a security disaster waiting to happen.

For the lazy, there is **SPV.**

Your argument is **BOLLOCKS.**

> consensus market, i.e. the users that are running bitcoin full nodes

that isn't a "market" or "consensus." The *market* is people buying and selling coins.  *Consensus* is hashpower.  Those are the two ways to "vote" in Bitcoin: mine or trade.  That's it.  Your personal copy of the blockchain means nothing to anyone *but you*.

There are ~5000 full nodes on the network today.  I can create another 5000 *tomorrow* for a few grand.  Do you really think that Bitcoin could possibly work if someone like me could impersonate half the network in a day in meaningful way?  No!!  That's why Satoshi use PoW not Proof-of-IP.  Read the [white paper](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)!!

> The soft fork allows other to not upgrade, and be fine. 

If you don't upgrade then the soft fork *eliminates the benefit you think your full node provides you* by reducing its security to no better than SPV.  Which is why you are actually the use-case for SPV.

> A hard fork, on the other hand, forces me to upgrade.

Welcome to the real world.  In what other world do you not have to upgrade your software?  Are you running Windows 95?  Is there a talking paperclip on your screen?  Have you ever seen what happens to a SQL server or web server if you don't stay current with upgrades for long enough?  If you want to "be your own bank" then you need to act responsible like one.
This. Segwit automatically cuts the capacity of your blockchain by roughly half due to its skewed incentives.  For example "4MB" Segwit actually can handle ~1.7 MB under real world conditions. The other 2.3MB isn't really available for normal use, but exists only as unused capacity.

Want the capacity of Bitcoin Cash on the Segwit chain? You'll need SW**4**X.  And even that will fall short (~20 tps vs Cash's 24+ tps).

Exactly.  I think what we are seeing in this sub is simply a very strong resonance with the ideas that he laid out.

When people talk about "the cost to run a fullnode" I think, "these people don't even Bitcoin."

1. First off, you almost surely don't need to run a validation node if you can't afford one

2. If you own Bitcoin, and need to run a validation node, the value of your bitcoins will far outpace the cost to protect them

3. Taking 1 & 2 together we can conclude most of the people complaining about validation node cost hold no bitcoins.

FORK THESE HOLDERS OFF THE CHAIN
> You need to understand that if you add additional layers to bitcoin, those are not 'separate things'

So do you.  You're part of a group of people advocating remaking Bitcoin from what was originally proposed into a different kind of thing altogether - and they call this utter transformation of the money-concept "immutability"!?!  It's astonishing the doublespeak they use if you aren't paying attention.

Turning Bitcoin from "P2P cash" into "P2P settlement gold" is literally "mutability" of the money in the most profound sense possible.  Particularly when you have also worked in scalable information systems, and you believe in a vision of Bitcoin that *scales onchain* as I do.  That's the real immutability: keeping the "money concept" the same.

So I go back to the original question that you kinda ducked.  When did you give up on P2P cash as proposed in the white paper, and believe that only a radically different vision could ever work?

Edit: I have no problem with people wanting LN to work - I have a problem with having vaporware jammed on top of the vision of Bitcoin that isn't being allowed to work.  There are a lot of great ideas for onchain scaling that are being squashed by Core's politics.  Stop foisting your Layer 2 solution onto Layer 1's scaling problem.  Layer 1 should scale to support as many transactions onchain as securely feasible.  Layer 2 can stand or fall on its own.  You claim a background in information systems.  Surely you appreciate the logic of what I just said.
I agree with you that BSV has an unusual degree of "purism."

This isn't that. Bitcoin isn't some museum project that needs to be "set in stone." Nor is it some other derivative project like a settlement layer for some other totally different payment network that may or may not work.  One must use discernment.

Bitcoin is peer to peer cash. Whoever implements peer to peer cash best, has implemented Bitcoin best.

Why? Because peer to peer cash is still the killer use case.
> It's time for us to upgrade to an alternate client on the main chain

> I don't believe it was the government. Just a company (Blockstream) that wants to make money on crippling on-chain

Dude, I love ya, but this is fantastically naive

Blockstream exists not to make money for itself, but to ensure the existing multitrillion-dollar revenue stream enjoyed by the entire fiat financial system.

People understand what desktop publishing and later blogging did to publishing; they know what Amazon did to retail; they know what Napster and Spotify did to music.  The world's richest people aren't stupid.  They know that technology can "come for them" just like it came for the publishers and retailers and musicians.  And they understand that to preserve their existing power - which goes far beyond an enormous revenue stream, but includes governments round the world - they have to kill the baby in its crib.

Just follow the money.  It's pretty straightforward whose interests are being protected.
> Bitcoin has evolved from peer to peer cash to also a store of value.

No, it doesn't work like that. 

BTC has "evolved" into a coin that cannot be depended on for P2P cash uses because of an intentional plan to cripple it.

The Bitcoin that continues to follow the plan outlined in the white paper (BCH) does not have this limitation and continues to function as P2P cash.

It remains to be seen if BTC can remain a "store of value" while having diminishing underlying utility.  Good luck!
The full name of Bitcoin (BCH) is "[Bitcoin: a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)" but most people find that too long.  We can shorten this to Bitcoin Cash or just Bitcoin (BCH). 

It's important to use the ticker if you just call it "Bitcoin" because other coins that deviate from the Bitcoin mission and objectives are also calling themselves "Bitcoin" but they use other tickers like BTG or BTC.
>All that shows is a lack of understanding. You only know that half of funds are *in channels with 0.4% of nodes*.

That's literally centralization.
>Bitcoin onchain is a routed payment network 

No, it is not, and you need to stop this disinformation. Onchain, funds flow only from sender to recipient and no intermediary ever has any form of custody of the funds. Miners serve merely as witnesses to the event.

With Lightning the funds are placed into joint custody (a Lightning channel) with your channel provider. To make a payment to an arbitrary user on the network requires the consent of your channel partner. Funds flow from your channel to the recipient through a payment route. Such a thing does not exist onchain in any form.
You could put a screen door on a submarine, too.
> Alot of people will state that he has no right to feel the way he does because of his perceived privelege. What a person ought to feel isn't nessecarily how they DO feel.

"There is no privileged frame of reference."
My definition of spam is specific. It is a form of attack on the network that results in extremely high fees and very unpredictable network performance.

Your definition of spam is arbitrary. It is "use cases I don't like."

If there is excess low-value added content being added, there is a different and much better tool to prevent that: the minfee. Miners are free to adjust this upward to discourage transactions that are not affordable to mine.  No miner is ever required to mine at a loss.

If there are identifiable classes of transactions you personally prefer not to store, prune them.

The whole point of this project is censorship resistance so be careful when you pride your preferences for preventing use cases.

Edit: toned down the unnecessary taunting
I'm inclined to agree with this view.
It's absolutely necessary IMO.

Right now there are any number of early adopting merchants sitting on the sidelines. They jumped into BTC support, then got burned because the community did a 180 and starting attacking organic merchant adoption, claiming that onchain adoption will never work.  Once fees got high, the merchant use case vanished.  These merchants got burned badly.

If we want to convince them that this isn't going to happen on BCH, then we need to "build it and they will come." People will want proof that what happened to BTC isn't going to just repeat on BCH. The only way to prove it is to... Prove it.

BCH and BTC are two separate tokens. Creating one does not make more of the other.

"Bitcoin" is an *idea* for a [peer to peer electronic cash system](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)  That idea is best expressed in BCH.
Here's a tip anyway: avoid any crypto project that has Blockstream behind it
I do not wish Core to raise the block size limit.

The whole point of limiting capacity onchain was to instead move consumer demand offchain. Like it or not, that's the chosen strategy. Segwit is barely adopted and Lightning Network is just now in alpha. Raising the block size will only hurt Segwit and Lightning adoption. If users want larger blocks on the Core chain they should instead use Segwit.  There's no point giving up on the strategy now, with Lightning release claimed to be imminent.

Politically speaking, if Core raises the block size now, after creating an army of people dead set against block size increases, the coin will certainly split yet again, and Core will have to implement replay protection, and become an altcoin.  That would really be the end of Core.
> They'll ridicule Lightning Network for no reason

Shame on them, when there are excellent reasons they could be using to ridicule Lightning Network.
"the claims made in it are not achievable with the technology described in it" - great description

Note: a few pro-Core shills have tried to counter this by arguing, from the other side of their mouths, that [Bitcoin has no reference implementation](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7lvnko/philip_daian_tired_of_this_core_is_decentralized/drqf033).

To these people, we need to constantly refer them to Wikipedia, and ask / demand that these people edit Wikipedia to reflect what they're saying (Bitcoin has no reference implementation). Don't fight us! Fight Wikipedia.

Also they should argue with their best buddy **Andreas Antonopolous**, whose best selling book "Mastering Bitcoin" declares Bitcoin Core to be the "reference":
 https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin-2nd/9781491954379/ch03.html

> Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation of the bitcoin system, meaning that it is the **authoritative reference on how each part of the technology should be implemented.**

Get it?

If you write any client that isn't fully compatible with Core, that's an altcoin

By definition: because it isn't compatible with "the Bitcoin reference."
are you talking about the r\/btc hack or Segwit?
> chat rooms.

You misspelled "dicksuck echo chamber"
I agree. Any coin with a "reference client" is actually just a bet placed on a particular software development team - the coin is essentially under the autocratic control of said team.  And Core is largely under Blockstream control, which means BTC is effectively under Blockstream control.

Who wants that? If I wanted to bet on specific dev teams and their homegrown technologies I'd buy stock in various companies. The whole point of crypto money for me was the "nobody controls it" aspect which means that the "reference client" concept is a big no-no.

One of the reasons I'm a big BCH supporter is that we not only "fired Core" but we also refuted the idea that the protocol is under the control of the One True Dev Team.  There is no Blessed Team in charge of a "reference client" and thus no central point of control / attack / failure.

Almost none of these people buying bitcoin have any intention of using as money, now or ever. They are gambling to get wealthy by placing bets on something they don't understand.  They wouldn't know "real Bitcoin" if it bit them and have real clue what the point is other than getting rich. They deserve any loss coming to them. No pity.
As an addition,

> Leadership on these projects means "getting rubber on the road." Teams need to learn how to take ideas, pour them into code, *and then get the community to run the code.*

We had XT, Classic, and BU all winning the war of ideas but not winning the war of getting people to run your code.

The code needed to do a block-height hard fork has been around since Satoshi, and @rocks had a working block-height hard fork client built and tested as far back as 2016.  Nobody implemented a successful one until ABC. The reason why is because it's nearly impossible to get people to support a minority fork.

I was around when @rocks was working on his client. Building the thing wasn't that hard. The hard part is "ok what now." Some people thought it would be fine for a handful of people to just start running the client and mining the chain, and if it was a better chain, people would use it. Others thought that we needed support from exchanges and miners, but securing that support would be very hard work.

And in fact, getting support from exchanges and miners (and businesses and end users) **is the hardest part.**

I repeat. The code is the easy part. Driving change is the hard part.

There may never be another durable Bitcoin fork like BCH. It's that hard. The Bitcoin Gold guys are learning that the hard way right now. Segwit2X may or may not happen and if it does a durable small-block fork may or may not survive.

Anyone can write code to cause a fork. Getting enough people to run your code is damn near impossible.

We have never been at a loss for good scaling ideas. Where we have consistently failed is in "getting people to run the software."

There has been some success of course, because BCH is a thing, it's real and it's not going away. 

In the software business when we have projects that go poorly and some that go well, we perform postmortems to understand what went right and what went wrong.

We've had a lot of failed opportunity to drive change and a limited amount of success. I suggest that we look at our successes and try to learn from them.
> I support Bitcoin and segwit.
>
> Do I also not understand development?

If the goal is scaling, Satoshi had the right idea in 2010:

http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/485/

> 
> It can be phased in, like:
> 
> if (blocknumber > 115000)
>     maxblocksize = largerlimit
> 
> It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
> 
> When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.

If that hypothetical plan had simply been followed, then the block size could have been increased (say, to 2MB) years in advance.  We could have put in the change when average block size was 512KB, in summer of 2015.  Had we done so, we could have planned the change for **one year** in advance and there would never have been a chainfork.  Instead we got the Contest of Egos and the War on Onchain Scaling which led to one chainfork already and there's about to be another.

Now clearly a well-planned fork of this sort needs more than just one line of code to implement --- however, *even this one-liner would have actually worked* had it been implemented as Satoshi recommended and there would have been no chainfork.

One line of code.  A little leadership.  Boom.  Done.

Do you have any idea how many lines of code had to be touched in order to get Segwit?

Now Segwit has other "benefits" such as providing a TM fix -- however, since we know LN is still *at least* 18 months away -- we don't really have a pressing need for a TM fix.  And other benefits are also minimal.

Mostly, it's a whole shit-ton of work and community division for very, very little benefit, and [possibly setback.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qniaa/one_last_time_before_its_too_late_segwit_will_cut/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage)

So I don't know why you as a developer think the amount of code change and associate risk in Segwit is actually "good development" when a terribly simple and straightforward solution was long on the table -- a solution which the community had already accepted as "the scaling solution" long before the Segwit/LN/"Satoshi's Bitcoin will never work" interlopers joined the team.  "Good development" is meeting expectations with minimum risk.  That is -- absolutely without question -- the Satoshi plan, *not* Segwit.
unfortunately, most of the development talent in the crypto space was chased out of Core and into altcoin development thanks to Core's less-than-delightful bedside manner, which is why most of the innovations in the space are happening elsewhere while supposedly talented Bitcoin devs spend their days trolling on reddit

Dear Mycelium devs: per [this document](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf), I would strongly suggest that you follow the chain with the most proof of work, unless it contains invalid transactions or blocks.

I would also add that no reasonably-sized block of otherwise valid transactions should be held to be invalid.

smartfbrankings always seems to me to have an uncanny way of knowing when his buddy Greg needs a hand in winning the argument.

However that doesn't mean that smartfbrankings *is* Greg - for example, they might be sitting next to each other (IRL or virtually) and Greg says, "hey can you come smack this bitch down for me).  This would create the strong appearance that smartfbrankings is a sock, when really he's just a buddy.

BTC got the upgrade. It's called BCH. Every BTC holder prior to the upgrade was automatically upgraded and has their upgraded BTC: Bitcoin CASH BCH. Every newcomer since then has had their choice to buy either the old, busted BTC or the new, upgraded BCH.

So look. If you were a holder prior to the split the only way you aren't participating in the upgraded Bitcoin today is because you chose to sell your upgraded coins. And if you arrived since the split, then if you aren't participating in the upgraded Bitcoin, then you can start participating by going to any exchange and trading your old busted BTC for the upgraded BCH. Congratulations you upgraded your Bitcoin.

As for BTC, let it go. You'll never reverse segwit. That ship sailed. *That's why we're here.*
Why would it. It's forty fucking cents. It doesn't need tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in proof of work to prove that it's not a double spend. 
How about this one: on LN, you have to have Bitcoin before you can receive Bitcoin....

Edit: what follows is that a handful of Lightning shills try to make the case that when someone sends you Bitcoin using an onchain transaction, that's really the Lightning Network doing the work. 😂😂😂

Edit 2: now the new talking point is that to receive a payment on LN you don't need to already have "BTC," just "liquidity." In the form of BTC.  You really can't make this shit up.

Edit 3: apparently in this sub [we upvote the guys trying to win the argument based on arguining the meaning of "have Bitcoin"](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/amve7a/eric_conner_jeez_i_didnt_even_dive_deep_into/efsbhcbok) and "[give Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/amve7a/eric_conner_jeez_i_didnt_even_dive_deep_into/efsmvsb)" 

fine whatever folks. I tried. 
He basically just explained it but let's break it down. 

Loans require **collateral**. They aren't gifts. Banks loan money only when they can collect something *even when you can't pay.*

The irony of debt is therefore that in almost all cases to get debt, you must first *have wealth.*

The exception to this is student debt, in which you, yourself, are the collateral. But that's an exception. 

Since going into debt allows you to invest (in a home, a car, an education, or a business) using money you don't have yet, it accelerates growth. If you had to save up in order to make the investment, you'd have to wait. Debt allows you to invest more readily, and begin producing now, instead of saving and waiting.

Economies that have better opportunities for investment produce more growth and more wealth.

And the more wealth you have, the more debt you can take on.

Lather rinse, repeat.

When you understand this aspect of economics it really drives home the benefits of a sound banking and monetary system. 

Countries without sound banking can get behind and it becomes exponentially harder for them to every catch up. See: Zimbabwe. 
#No changes should be made whatsoever unless these two conditions are met:

* clear **use cases** related to p2p cash must be described. For example we know that changing from 10 mins to 2 or 1 min doesn't change *anything at retail*.  So the proponents of this change need evidence of a compelling p2p cash use case that would be enabled by 1-2 min blocks

* adequate **scientific evidence** is collected that identifies the optimal range of block times needed to maximize potential use cases without increasing the orphan rate

Do not be confused. We should not be against changing the block time. We should ALL be against changing anything without a compelling use case and scientific data to support the change, when available. 

There is this strong movement to change block times, with many advocates,  none able to articulate a compelling use case, and none with any scientific evidence to back up their change requests.

I suspect this is the new movement to split BCH again.

You say you are not a troll, but your account is suspicious: four years old, no karma, only in the last month you started using it, and only to push for your block time agenda.

Edit: honestly in addition to the above requirements, proponents of shorter block times need to also produce an impact assessment of current use cases that could be negatively impacted by this change (ie apps that expect 10 min interblock time that will need to be changed). 
That's right.

Also, don't forget: the entire legacy payment system is "Layer 2"

> BSV is likely to bring a potential fork of Bitcoin Cash by causing incompatibility with Bitcoin Cash network and therefore create a new cryptocurrency asset 

Wow, they got this totally wrong. Shame on them. This is a hashwar not a coinsplit.
Well, look.  Since Day 1 there has never been a defense against a dishonest majority mining attack.  It's why Satoshi hammered the assumption of majority honesty so hard in the white paper.

In that regard Bitcoin has always been a fascinating social sciences experiment: is plutocracy ultimately stable or unstable, and / or does it produce societally-useful results.

There is really no way to know for sure if nChain is an honest or dishonest participant in the community.  Is CSW personally a liar?  Yeah.  So?  If his incentives are aligned, then his company must honestly mine, die, or get constant fiat infusions from somewhere -- which will become apparent quickly.

If an infinite supply of fiat wants to choke the baby, well dude, that was always part of the risk we took, and there's no defense against it.  Never was.  But what we must agree on, I think, is that there is no better way to assure alignment to long-term objectives than investment in hashpower.

And, if nChain's strategy is to kill Real Bitcoin by preventing it from growing, they're on the wrong side of the blocksize controversy.
Bitcoin Core is the *reference* implementation for the BTC protocol.

Bitcoin.com's owner announced a year ago that if Segwit2X turned out to be a bait-and-switch to enable Segwit then pull out of the 2X upgrade, that he would shift all his company resources to promoting Bitcoin Cash, which is the version of Bitcoin that attempts to continue the original plan of large-blocks scaling. 

So I guess he's just living up to his word and not devoting new resources to BTC.
That tweet is so dumb it's beneath even you.

> scaling completely onchain is absurd

Agreed!  99.9% of all crypto transactions are already offchain, or hadn't you noticed?

Are you done making out with that strawman or are you gonna go all the way to third base with it?

>Certain group of devs didn't anticipate that centrally planned blockchain leads to congestion and ludicrously high fees. Also the smartest guys around.

Oh no they knew it would happen and celebrated when it did.
Exactly, which is why Satoshi was correct about section 6.
Yep. A lot of people haven't bothered to figure this out yet, but BTC can never increase block size "natively". Any attempt at a hard fork now would absolutely require replay protection, which would split the coin, and the upgraded fork would have to spin itself off as an altcoin.
I often don't lock my doors. I guess the lock hardware was a waste.
If he published bit GOLD then why is Bitcoin peer to peer CASH?

This guy tried to create digital gold for fifteen years, then it's like he bumped his head, he SOLVES the problem and for two years he goes around as Satoshi pushing his solution as peer to peer CASH, then he wakes up and immediately switches back to gold and spends another seven years bashing this idea of CASH and a bunch of other shit he said when he was having his dissociative episode as Satoshi.

The hubs.  It's literally the same topology as banks.
In recent months it's become much better understood that mining does not behave like a mesh net, but like a (nearly) fully connected graph.

Understanding this aspect of mining topology has a potentially profound impact on all kinds of assumptions we make about Bitcoin. Some people have been trying to elevate discussion to get people thinking about ways we might have been misunderstanding Bitcoin all along.

The SM paper has recently come under scrutiny because if mining is in fact a (nearly) fully connected graph, at least some of the conclusions in the SM paper may be incorrect.

Unfortunately one of the most prominent spokespeople for these ideas is a public relations disaster so many people are unable to even hear the arguments.

Edit: I'll add that other, more respected people in the field are often quite guilty as well of defending ideas with ad hominem and bluster instead of polite rationality
> Why would Alice lock funds into a channel with Bob, when they already both opened a channel with Amazon...

... and why would Amazon, **which isn't in the liquidity-provisioning or payment-routing business**, want to be responsible for holding on to these LN endpoints with Alice, Bob, and a billion other people? 

They wouldn't. So really, Alice, Bob, and Amazon all have channels with the same hub. Let's just call it Citibank. Citibank is in the liquidity-provisioning and payment-routing business, and they'd be happy to offer this service to Alice, Bob, and Amazon.

LN is nothing more than SWIFT with some crypto on top.
When you read compelling arguments like this one, you start to clearly understand why BTC is the dominant market leader that it is today.
I never post price hype because I don't trade but I've been thinking we're about to break out really big just on adoption fundamentals.

There's been an enormous campaign to suppress Bitcoin Cash. [There's a straight line from the first hints of organized opposition to Bitcoin that starts with the tulip bubble trolls and leads straight to the opposition against big blocks and finally against Bitcoin Cash](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/z/dl8v4lp), and it's reaching a crescendo.

The thing is that [the truth is still leaking out](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/), faster and faster, that Bitcoin was always supposed to be Cash. We're seeing waves of companies jumping into the space with political statements proclaiming Bitcoin Cash to be the rightful [Bitcoin: a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf).

It just seems like, at the adoption level, something big is about to finally break out.  With all the suppression and disinformation, if/when this happens, it seems impossible to guess the magnitude of disruption it will cause.
You need a node to use LN "trustlessly"

Otherwise you're using SPV or someone else's trusted node, which any Core evangelist will tell you opens you up to any number of "attacks from miners."

If it wasn't for these purported attacks, then we could just use big blocks and SPV like Satoshi specified in the white paper. The whole point of Lightning Network is that  "SPV is insecure and won't work so we can't scale onchain" remember?
That's a strange way of looking at it.

Bitcoin (BTC) has fully saturated blocks limited to roughly 1MB. It has now reached a stasis where demand had dropped enough that it exactly matches supply or just a little less. As soon as demand begins to grow, fees will go right back up, because block space supply is exhausted.

So **BTC has already hit its adoption peak.** For BTC to continue to have the same onchain fees, it cannot grow in adoption (demand).

If you give even one shit about fundamentals that is a profoundly strong sell indicator.

shame on you, seriously.  you should honestly question either your facts, or your purpose as a human being

> Bitcoin, the software, scales linearly. This is because its algorithmic solution to the question of "were these funds spent already?" is to make **everyone** aware of every transaction that has ever existed.

No no no no no no no. (Sing to tune of Bohemian Rhapsody)

Not "everyone." Only miners and validation / archival nodes. Almost no end user needs this data.

no, obvious scams are obvious
> They are insecure in their notion of bitcoin.

they have every reason to be
> Don't feel like getting banned from rbitcoin today.

that's like saying you don't want to get kicked out of the crack den

> I got into Bitcoin to *spend* Bitcoin.

I also got into Bitcoin to spend Bitcoin; however, I find that no merchants are accepting Bitcoin at my exchange rate, which based on Bitcoin's likely value to the world over time, I have calculated to be worth roughly $1M/BCH.
Preach. I couldn't agree more, especially with:

>If you are not guaranteed to get your transactions included in the next one or maybe two blocks, then your crypto is a total failure.

Yep.

> I can't believe we're even having this debate in 2017.

Doesn't the fact that we are still here having this discussion mean that the attack is working?
There are currently five teams building Bitcoin full nodes. Four of them agree on what is Bitcoin and one doesn't.

Hmmmm.
> I can only think of one reason: since blockchain space supply is completely inelastic, even tiny fluctuations in interest in Bitcoin would cause large unpredictable swings in confirmation time and thus large swings in fees. 

Yes.

Also, "fees" is a misnomer. Bitcoin doesn't actually have "fees."

"Fees" are prices announced in advance which, when paid, gives the buyer an expectation of service.

Bitcoin doesn't work like that. Miners can't post fees. Instead, users have to guess what amount will be sufficient to entice a miner to mine the transaction.

That's not a "fee." That's a "bounty." And bounties don't naturally form "markets."
If you are comfortable with a trusted, centralized version of Lightning then it may be possible for only centralized hubs to care about routing.

If you want to use Lightning to make decentralized P2P transfers, then all participants must know all routes.

Edit: I think that it should be possible to achieve something like "good enough" routing without forcing all participants to know all routes; however, routing was a known issue when Lightning was first proposed almost 2 years ago, and the fact that the current implementation hasn't achieved anything better than "spray and pray" should be a wakeup call.
The minority chain must protect itself against replay.

What's depressing is watching a troll army hijack one of the greatest inventions in human history to reengineer it into a corporate banking network.

He made three statements that are patently true.

> Yes, this is a known weakness in segwit that was never fixed.

Fact.

> It doesn't mean that segwit coins are necessarily insecure,

Fact

> the security model for segwit coins is strictly weaker than for bitcoins. 

Fact.
