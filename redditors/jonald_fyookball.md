suddenly they like hard forks?  I love this comment:

>Come on, you'd rather change the PoW than double the block size? Serious?

These people have totally lost the plot.
Yes!  Thank you CoinMarketCap for not submitting to the rotten evil forces here.  Bitcoin must thrive as PEER TO PEER ELECTRONIC CASH.  You will not steal the Bitcoin brand for the banks, Dennis.  Begone, vampire!
Everyone was waiting for 9k though. As someone who enjoys the DragonballZ series I actually lol at the meme.  
Since I am hodling on both chains, all higher prices is good.
A month or two ago, I read a comment on reddit that said that Calvin and Craig aren't smart enough to succeed in crypto because they don't understand it's a new game with new rules.  (It requires cooperation rather than aggression.)

I think today's events are an indicator that whoever made the comment was spot on.  Apparently the market is not taking kindly to the BSV principals suing everyone.  (What a surprise, right?)
> Gregory Maxwell private messaged me about the post vilifying me calling me a liar and also saying to me "You greedy, controlling fuck" 

talk about projection...
I've always had a lot of respect for Joseph Poon.  He was never the one shilling for LN to be a replacement for on chain scaling.   And he was the one who revealed the existence of the Dragon's Den.


FWIW, Calin Culianu and myself applied for one of Craig's bounties,
involving a stenography app.

https://www.yours.org/content/angel-funding-project-1-3d4b0cf87d9e

We provided a working prototype, got the run around for a few months, and then were booted out of slack for supporting Bitcoin ABC.  Needless to say, we did not receive any money.


Yes I was removed from bchslack.  Dissapointing because I thought I was extremely civil; in fact I reached out to Craig and told the community I was looking foward to meeting with Craig and others in Bangkok so that we could work together on a non-contentious fork.  I can only imagine that my comments (mostly factual rather than opinion) defending ABC on reddit were not welcomed.  

That is ok.  I still look forward to meeting with Craig and others in Bangkok.


Yes its another attack.  I got their fake repo removed and then my profile got flagged.  #terrified.

I wouldn't worry too much. I'm sure it will be back when they review it.  Meanwhile, most users will simply use the website.

But who will they attack next?  These people are scum.

I like how they did it on a Friday so Github will be slower to respond.  Nice touch.

The facts that he got paid a million dollars, the fact that he gets paid to speak at BTC events, the fact that he would be socially attacked (and possibly physically threatened) if he supported BCH.
Right now, at this moment, blockchain.info is showing me 32776 unconfirmed tx.  24 hours ago, it was about 1400 unconfirmed tx.

This says 2 things to me:

1. First, we have this cycle where fees getting increasingly high until users are sick of it, and just stop using bitcon, at which point the fees become low again... with ridiculous excuses http://i.imgur.com/pm71ocH.png

2. It illustrates the lack of substance in a coin that is not used as a payment system.  The actual growth of usage is severely capped so its only useful to a small set of people.  Meanwhile, when investors panic and want to get out, 
they can't even sell their coins.
>I find this a frankly baffling and inexplicable behavior in a businessman

If there's one thing I learned throughout all of the social attacks on Bitcoin, it's that irrational behavior is the hallmark of ulterior motives.  

For example, when the BTC core developers refused to raise the blocksize or even discuss it, it was not because any of the BS reasons their shills gave.  They simply wanted and insisted on keeping the blocks small, no matter what.

When CSW walked out of the Bangkok meeting, it wasn't because he was crazy or ABC was out of line... They just never intended to collaborate in the first place.


Very telling, that even Gavin, who is usually extremely polite, diplomatic, and apolitical, is now saying what many of us have been saying for a while.
Bitcoin Cash might literally not exist today without him
Says the guy who won't support the peer to peer electronic cash version of bitcoin.
>how the fuck did these idiots take over all of bitcoin ? 

Because miners were too lazy to think for themselves and trusted core.  Also because of censorship, incrementalism, propaganda, bribery, and lies.
Core was desperate to avoid hard forks. If they allowed one to increase block size, more would come, which would allow bitcoin to be global currency.  Core's unstated goal is to prevent BTC from being peer to peer electronic cash. 
such nice people these Blockstream Core folk. All these accusations of toxicity -- i'm just not seeing it. /s
I'm convinced Greg and Luke are professional trolls.  They say the darndest things.  Even Vitalik is sometimes forced to response to the nonsense.  Like Luke saying blocks should be 300kb and Greg saying "fees are half a satoshi/byte most weekend" or "there were nodes before miners".  It's time to stop paying attention to these professional saboteurs and focus on what's important -- getting merchants on board with Bitcoin (BCH).

Discuss Bitcoin..in one of the pre-approved ways.

Pre-approved ways you can discuss bitcion on r/bitcoin

1 attacking 'bcash' or people in BCH or any business that supports it.

2 price predictions (must be moon or at least bullish)

3  memes

4 Lightning Network (only praise)

5 occasionally decent content as long as it doesn't challenge BTC or its roadmap.



Unacceptable? It's despicable.
we've been saying that for years.  why's it still on coinmarketcap?
Money is perhaps the ONE thing that you really REALLY want to keep on the base layer, for obvious reasons.  
Nice try Luke.  /r/bitcoin guidelines say:

>Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.

But everyone was permitted to talk about UASF.. that surely didn't have overwhelming consensus.  Who decides what is "overwhelming" consensus anyway?   Why can't people discuss ideas?  What are you afraid of?  No, this doesn't seem like censorship at all.
I talk to a few of the electrum guys on irc that I'm pretty sure are real people and they believe in core.  So they do exist.  I don't bother to debate or convince them. They believe in core and that's fine.
since when are miners an external entity
Goddamn i hope these all these Core pussies make good on their word and leave Bitcoin after 2x happens.  
Wow.  These clowns really do intend on their own minority fork.  They'll have the smallest blocks and smallest hashpower and the smallest price... but hey -- they'll have Bitcoin.org -- I mean, that makes them the true Bitcoin,right? /s
holy crap u/awemany was the one who discovered and reported the bug?  dang ... u da man! :)
yeah that is not surprising.  I have thought about playing around with LN but it seems too complicated to spend my time on it.  And I'm a wallet dev for cryin out loud.  Certainly not the greatest dev in the world, but i'm probably more tech savvy than the average grandma.  As with anything, I'm sure I (or anyone else) could figure it out if I put in the effort, but i'm not going to bother.  That should tell you something.
Very disappointing.  
i've felt that way 100 times in this scaling debate.

"1 megabyte blocks?  I can download 100 megabytes in 7 seconds.  Doesn't anyone else notice this?  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills."

"They're talking about censorship resistant money and they want to force people off the blockchain.  Doesn't anyone else notice this?  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills"


keep up the great work.  education is very important.  u/tippr $20
Wait , he has all that money but couldn't give eatbch the 150k usd that he promised ?  
u/tippr $50 

Put a website url!  and do more.
There is no planned split.  You do not speak for Bitcoin Cash, and frankly you are abusing the right to hold the BitcoinCash reddit user handle.


I feel safer with 300 kb blocks like Luke Jr says is safe.  He's a core developer, after all.  I trust him.  
/u/thomaszander thank you for everything you have done for Bitcoin.

This is the new way my friends...some implementations will fade, others will be born.  To the future!
Good. let SW compete with big blocks.  
The timing of this message isn't suspicious at all.
So, let me get this straight...Core knew about this for over 2 months... they knew JJ would be speaking about it...then hours after he spoke about it, Bitclub starts the attack on Bitcoin Cash.by publishing those huge output tx.....and we're supposed to believe it was all Bitclub acting on their own...it had nothing whatsoever to do with Core? 

Really?

focus on adoption and the price will take care of itself beyond your wildest dreams.
"THEY USED TO USE BITCOIN"

https://imgur.com/a/etoB5

Greg Maxwell left me negative feedback on Bitcointalk for apparently no other reason than he didn't like me challenging his authority (while giving positive feedback to 2 people who advocated small blocks).  Weeks later, I asked extremely politely for him to remove it and he told me "you belong in a jail cell".  I can only imagine that in his mind I'm "endangering" developers because I advocate for big blocks.

If you want some good examples of how he operates, here is some good reading:  

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6cmtff/2_more_blatant_lies_from_blockstream_cto_greg/


WTF!@ i just read this and i cant believe it.  i do my best to be polite, but f@#k you guys, seriously.  When one of my employees needs to get paid, they can't wait 2 weeks.  You selfish pricks have no clue, no empathy for the users.  f@#king assholes.
Andreas used to talk so passionately about banking the unbanked. Come back to the light brother.
don't worry, people know now that you shouldnt try to actually use BTC too much, so it probably won't get too bad.
Yep, you read it right.  They (Greg, Peter Todd) initially wanted zero.  (Luke actually wanted smaller blocks).   When Mike Hearn said "they don't want Bitcoin to grow", he sounded crazy at the time to some people.  Turns out he was 100% right.  
u/tippr gild

This article reveals a few important things:

1. Data shows that block propagation is a serious bottleneck in the short-medium term.
2. Data shows that CTOR would provide significant improvement to Graphene and other (Xthiner) schemes.

I think they censored it because it was a little TOO obvious.  

BTC has no real principles left.  Almost everything their thought leaders say is expedient and mercurial.  

Payments are good if fees happen to be cheap this week or if we're talking about layer 2.  If fees are high this week, well that's what keeps bitcoin secure and you must be stupid if you don't get it.  Blocks aren't full, thanks to segwit and batching but if they are, it must be someone spamming like veriblock.  When in doubt blame Roger.  /s
for those who dont get it yet, here's what's going on: Bitcoin was sabotaged.  It was p2p cash that was working fine until the blocks were stopped from growing and the devs insisted we try to scale with the Lightning Network.  Which as you can see from this article, doesn't even come close to working. in real life.
Let's try to think a few moves ahead here... once BTC falls out of #1 position, everything about BTC is going to come under questioning.   If its #2, it can be #10 and if it can be #10 it can be #40.  There will be a huge dumpening if it ever loses top spot which could make this a self fulfilling prophecy.  the bigger they come the harder they fall.
What a goddamn idiot.  People having the freedom to fork off when they don't agree with the direction of the project is fundamental to bitcoin.  It's a key part of what makes bitcoin free and permissionless. If you've been in Bitcoin a while and still don't understand this then I really don't know what to say except:  please get a clue and get educated.
Nice.  Yeah I love these blatant contradictions.  Don't  think us pointing it out will stop them either, they'll be saying "not everyone needs a node" off the back of luke JR saying youre not really using bitcoin if you dont run a node.
you wont hear about that on r/bitcoin. you might see some really cool 12k memes though.
I sense a great disturbance in the force. As if 1000 core fan bois cried out in pain and were suddenly silenced.
Nice doublespeak/ double-standards.  I love how you want the "anyone can run whatever code they want" applied to Core, so therefore no one is in charge...but when BU publishes code, they are doing things "forcibly against the will of many of its users".  Satoshi's plan always involved eventually-expensive mining nodes, but unrestricted transactional access.  If you're not going to go along with this, then you support a radically different vision which I'm just gonna call 'settlement network'.  Call it whatever you want, but if you want to appear honest, you might want to at least admit you are trying to change the system that Satoshi created.
another fun fact: Roger owns Bitcoin.com because he had the vision and business sense to acquire it before anyone else did.
TLDR: CSW made another basic mistake on twitter (claiming the probability of 2 blocks being found within 20 seconds is "0.01%" when is it closer to 3%), makes an article about a different problem, which I'm not even sure is correct, and attacks Peter Rizun (again) in the process.

Thanks for the positive comments.  

I'd like to address a few of the concerns.

First, I don't see that Electron Cash is going
to be utilizing any patented tech for the foreseeable
future.  The 3 projects I'd like to prioritize
are a better android version, an iOS version,
and a feature phone (Nokia) version... so that
everyone on the planet can use this wallet.

There has been some discussion of Dr. Wright's
"blinded signatures", which may be patented,
but I think it is best to leave that out of
the main client for a few reasons, and
let the CashShuffle people (or others)
develop that as a plugin if they wish.

Even if there is some patented piece of
technology that finds its way into Electron
Cash in the future, the project is easily 
forkable at any point prior, as it is 
currently under the MIT lisence.  

I will have to look into what lisences
will be used for new development (for
example iOS), as the intention is that
the funding benefit Bitcoin Cash and
not other coins...however a valid point
was raised about what happens if in
the future there is another chain split.

So that is something to think about.

I understand we must always be vigilant
about avoiding another 'Blockstream capture'.
I think it is less of a concern with an 
SPV client like Electron Cash versus
a full node software because SPV is going
to have to follow what the miners are doing.

I could tell you that I have a high
level of belief that nChain is beneficient,
or that I would refuse funding if I suspected
anything nefarious (both true), 
but those sentiments are irrelevant to the
concerns, because at the end of the day,
anyone can choose to become a bad actor.  

What's the solution?

In the long term, I think that education
is the only way to avoid more "UASF" type
situations, brigading, and undue influencing
of the miners.

Remember, the last thing "they" want is a well
informed, well educated populace... conversely,
this is the ultimate weapon to keeping peer to
peer electronic cash alive and well.  And
this is why I've made efforts with writing
articles and such.

Comments in that thread are just sad.  Some of these people actually see the miners as blocking segwit (which was never desired to begin with and was something core pulled out of their ass) instead of core blocking an increase.
Yeah but you know what... it doesn't matter... We think the Bitcoin brand (or "Bitcoin Cash") is so great, but what are we actually doing with it?  

All that matters is onboarding users and merchants.  If we're not doing that, we could have the greatest name in the world and nobody would care.

Time to focus on acquiring users.  We can call it whatever we want with them.  Yes it is bad they are trying to slander the name but if we focus on that and spend a lot of energy on it, we lose double.

Adoption, adoption, adoption!
Vin gets it.  Anyone paying attention, educated, and not deluding themselves gets it.
Anyone can publish code and announce it.  If the miners run it, that is Nakamoto consensus.  

ABC did the best they could under the circumstances, tried to be as inclusive as possible, given the timeframes and lack of any established process.

Many are hoping that in the future things will be smoother, more coordinated, and less contentious.  

I don't blame devs like Tom Zander that are unhappy with how things unfolded.  At this point, the best thing to do is support Bitcoin Cash while working on a better process for the future.


are you just realizing this now Bruce?  time to hop off the fence and take a stand against Blockstream Core.  They're not going to hire you -- you lost that gig to Mow...so you might as well fight with us to make Bitcoin great again.
Totally Satoshi.  I mean this sounds like just the kind of thing Satoshi would say.  To the T.  

No doubt in mind we're dealing with the legit creator of Bitcoin here.
SegWit is a bad design on the most fundamental level as it intentionally breaks the chain of digital signatures.  This changes the security model and puts more reliance on miners to hold everything together.  Without SegWit, you can prove ownership of a coin because every spend TX must prove its signature.  With SegWit , the signature is only necessary for miners at the time of validation.  It then becomes not only prunable, but not even part of the main merkle tree which links the transactions together.  No thanks.


Big kudos to the developer Calin Culianu.  Looks amazing!
"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it"
This is VERY relevant to the scaling debate.  All the arguments of "Bitcoin doesn't need to be a payment network because it will be the digital gold of crypto with the highest security" went right out the window.   

At least bitcoin is immutable and simple and no one is calling for complicated new transaction types, certainly not with kludgey soft forks...oh wait.. /S
 
[Miners, please wake up.](https://keepingstock.net/an-open-letter-to-bitcoin-miners-c260467e1f0)



great.  Go use BTC then or whatever coin you want.  Nobody's stopping you.  
 half is HUGE.
This is exactly the kind of misinformation that needs to be corrected.

I'll go point by point:

>Bitcoin is committed to scaling in the long run while maintaining decentralization. Bitcoin Cash just wants to raise the block limit.

The Bitcoin community SAYS they want to maintain decentralization, but making the blocks smaller, or making it easier to run a fully validating, but non-mining node, does NOT accomplish this.  Bitcoin is only secured by miners.  The number of non-mining nodes is easily spoofed and inflated, which was the entire reason Bitcoin exists as a proof-of-work system.

Just as important:  Second layer systems like the Lightning Network cause centralization in a different way by restricting transactions and eroding the permissionless peer-to-peer nature of the system.

Blocks have to get bigger...and they can easily get much, much bigger while still running a node on a high end laptop.  

>It has very loud proponents including someone who attempted to pass himself off as Satoshi, but most people can see through them.

Irrelevant.

>Ironically its hardly used at all, used even less than dogecoin at times

Not true.  It is almost used as much as litecoin.  Source:
https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-bch-ltc.html#3m

>It also has very few serious developers 

Not true at all.  There's 5 full node implementations: Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin XT, Bitprim, Parity... I also hear Tom Zander from Bitcoin Classic is starting up again under a new name..and Bitcrust will have a full node implementation this year... so that's 7 groups...each with multiple "serious" developers.

>Providing off chain scaling through lightning just increases the utility of bitcoin and empirically has not resulted in centralized hubs so far: https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/952611979742601216

No hubs there? I certainly see some centralized hubs there, clearly.

>Even if lightning did cause hubs to form people would still have the option to make on chain transactions

Yeah, if they pay a higher fee than everyone else.  Can't fit 20 people on a 10 seat bus.

>I think its unfortunate that bitcoin cash is pushed so hard by some and in such a misleading way but I think anyone who puts a lot of thought into the matter will conclude that bitcoin is superior to bitcoin cash.

Your opinion... but I think it's unfortunate that Bitcoin Cash is attacked so hard by some in such a misleading way, but I think anyone who puts a lot of thought into the matter will conclude that Bitcoin Cash is superior to BTC.




It is clear that the technical reasons to oppose bigger blocks are false.  It is entirely business/strategic/economic/political.  
That's a very good question. Ultimately, Bitcoin is a permissionless system so people can do whatever they want. And I'm not saying ABC is perfect.  However, nChain has done a number of things that I consider to be not in good faith.

1. There was an agreement on the 6 month forking schedule with a 3 month cutoff and the changes (CTOR plus DSV) had been discussed for a long time. There was no contention and nChain even supported them in a published statement last year.  A week before the cutoff nChain suddenly decided they would do everything possible to block these changes.  The timing felt like sabotage to me.

2. Nchain never gave good reasons for this.  There was either just no explanation or fake explanation (dsv causes loops etc)

3. The Bangkok meeting was held as an emergency effort to avoid a contentious upgrade. Nchain chief didnt listen to other speeches and walked put. Other nchain people essentually refused to discuss anything technical. 

4. CSW banned everyone who disagreed with him from slack and Twitter and created an echo chamber of misinformation.

5. Propaganda (wormhole etc) was deliberately pushed 

6. CSW threatened to 51% attack business and exchanges. Even now he is threatening to censor transactions, etc

There is probably a lot more , but that is just off the top of my head.
bitcoin has been become so broken that the truth will come out quickly now.  just watch :)  and thanks for being part of it.
They are part of that social attack, so I will never use their service.  And I will recommend others do not as well.  
Not actually "revoked" -- it was just down because of ICANN whois innaccuracy complaint which was resolved.  Weak sauce of the registrar to not notify me first.

Bigger picture:  All the trolls in the world can't stop the honey badger :)

QHOSTER.  I don't recommend them.  Will be moving soon.
'they' are spending a ton on rented hash probably , to make it look like they are stronger , as hash is their only card.  Others waiting till the 15th when it matters. 
Code is basically done.  github.com/clifordsymack/Electron-Cash

We are testing , debugging, reviewing, documenting, etc. :)
sounds like it could be bip133 related.  There should be some clarity/cooperation across the ecosystem and figure out what the minimum fee and dust are to relay tx.  That way wallets can make it clear to users what settings are good for 0 conf.  

I think cheaper settings are ok to have as long ("miners choice") as long it is clear to the community which ones are reliable for 0-conf.
Even if you're all in BCH , great news as it will help all coins.
Love it!  Greg, everytime you open your mouth, you just give ammunition to the opposition.  In case you haven't figured it out yet, it doesn't matter how clever you are, because when you take a position contrary to reality, you just end up taking a piss on yourself.  It's the law of the universe.

This quote will live in infamy for a long time.

>There were nodes before miners - Greg Maxwell
These guys are playing with fire.  I wonder how long before someone sues CoinGeek/nChain for their actions in the fork.  That lawsuit would have a lot more merit.
Recent research into anti reorg algotithms (protection agaunst 51% attack) reveals block delay penalties to be the most promising tool. And these strategies benefit from the average block time being much larger than the block propagation time. This alone is a good reason not to shorten the block times.
Just to provide some context, I think the deterministic key generation that is patented involves blinded signatures -- essentially another way to do multisig except it would have the benefit of the exchange not even knowing what your address is.  

So, I don't think this has anything to do with the normal "HD" wallet stuff.

It should also be noted that as it is today, you need permission from exchange to do anything.  I think it would be better to have users in control of exchange funds (even if there was a patent involved) than the exchanges having control.


amazing price hasnt dropped more, its actually increased in the last month
Nothing sudden about it.  He's always been here.Maybe its because the discussion at r/bitcoin is so idiotic, all the people with half a brain are over here already.
this is seriously one sided.  No one who supports BCH calls it bcash.  Sounds like an edit war but what can be done?  

Also its not even correct.  OkEX didn't stop trading BCH, it just stopped BCH base pairs.  This is very misleading.
this is beyond cool.  
Funny as hell. Let them have their layer 2 scaling.
Because it destroys their lie that all (or most) users need to run full nodes, which they then use to promote the idea that we need to keep the blocks small.
pisses me right off too.
don't make fun of people with disabilities.
Not good enough.  Bitcoin Cash or go home.  

I'm serious -- we need a globally accepted peer to peer cash system.  Not just "blockchain tech" that's split into 1000 different coins.


Say what you want about CSW, he has the right to free speech as much as anyone.  


 "Something needs to be done"?  Sounds like a threat to me.   Screw you, Shamson.  You are a creep and Blockstream is a scourge.

 
But won't this result in a capacity increase?  I consider this an attack on Blockstream's ability to profit from layer 2 solutions.  [#NOGRAPHENE] 

/s
The audacity of him to ask for another 6 months on top of the years of stalling.  pretty amazing.
I would love to have a time machine and go back pre-segwit and tell them "I guarantee that in the weeks after SegWit activates, you'll have only 1-2% usage." What kind of responses would we get? :)
>Is this guy for real?

He might be.  Apparently he doesn't know yet that the Wormhole conspiracy is about as real as the Easter bunny riding a magic unicorn with a basket of 3 dollar bills.
A lot of people worked very hard to thwart this attack, and I appreciate all of them... but Amaury does deserve special recognition.  He deserves a lot of gratitude.  Second time he's "saved Bitcoin".

Thanks dude :)
this needs more exposure.  r/bitcoin crowd is blind to the obvious.   Its clear they are just going to leapfrog the LN and go right to something that actually works on the second layer... in an even more centralized manner.
What else do you expect from a certified Blockstream fanboy?

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DE9JQs2UMAA93hc.jpg
agree, but we have no idea whether this transfer will take a month, a year, or a decade. 
both Electrum and Electron Cash are constant targets for impersonation with theftware.  

As a reminder, electroncash.org is the only site for Electron Cash wallet.
If you read the first paragraph of Greg's reply it almost sounds like he says "stop pretending I'm aware, we were sort of aware but I'm actually smarter than Sipa and I was even more aware"... i mean you can't make this stuff up! Then again who knows what he is really talking about.
Well even though the fundamentals are bad right now, that can change, and a lot of people want to change and are trying to have it change, as evidence by BU, ext blocks, and other proposals.  I don't know how much longer the struggle will continue.  I've diversified but still hold majority in Bitcoin.  It still has the most security , biggest network, most well known brand, and most marketshare.  Things are not healthy but its too soon to just give up on it.
Excellent work, and thank you for help leading the charge with this and your expertise.  You helped me to iron out some of the bugs in [my proposal](https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/on-solving-the-51-attack-problem-in-bitcoin-part-3-d19d5331f97f).  I hope something like what you're proposing can be adopted in Bitcoin Cash so we never have to put up with lunatics and tyrants again.
>I wonder if they understand...

They don't, obviously
hi Joel.... First of all, yes I support bitcoin ABC.  They are the most competent protocol developers in BCH with a proven track record.  Even the SV goal of "128mb" wouldn't be possible without fixing network layer code, which ABC has done.  In addition, ABC helped to code/test the last set of op codes which nChain wanted...which is why they were not in a rush to prioritize nChain's new codes over BU's proposal.  It is facts like these that your group did not like me posting about.  

But in general, I am loyal to bitcoin as peer to peer electronic cash; not one group or developer.  I attempted to express my desire to see all of us unite behind a non contentious fork since we all want the same thing ostensibly (global cash).  

Some of the things you are saying are pure propaganda (i.e. "wormholecoin").

Finally, Please drop the "my slack" stuff and do not pretend that you are doing anything other than taking direct orders from Craig.   
I was involved early in Bitcoin Cash.  The first version
of Electron Cash was published prior to Aug 1.  I
can tell you that Roger was not involved, at least
that I am aware of.

There are several full node implementations of
Bitcoin Cash.  Each has its own governance structure
and policies.  There is informal communication between
the various groups but no formal overarching 'global'
governance.

Looks like electron cash :)
have you read [my letter to the miners](https://keepingstock.net/an-open-letter-to-bitcoin-miners-c260467e1f0)   its a good summary of the entire scaling debate.
AA makes great points as usual.  The first great point he makes is ""form your own damn opinion. I'm no more the authority you should listen to than anyone else."  Overall I found his response to be typical AA.  He's always   been fairly neutral so i'm not really buying into the narrative that he's been "compromised by Blockstream".  Second point he makes:  He's been in favor of bigger blocks this whole time.  Third point he makes:  "HF without a high percentage will be damaging" -- meaning only 51% not 75%.  I agree with this and hope the miners don't try to 'activate' with only 51%.   I do not agree with about the 'rulers' as fundamentally I do not believe the blocksize limit should be part of the protocol rules because it has proven to be too contentious.  On the downside,  I think what Core/Blockstream has done with stonewalling the block increase and choking the bandwidth is an elephant in the room and its a little disappointing that AA doesn't take a stand against this or hasn't spoke out.
New features include:

- OP_RETURN.  You can post your own messages to the blockchain by enabling OP_RETURN in preferences.  Be careful kids :)

- New custom fees.  Fee interface has been simplified and you can set fees lower than 1 sat/byte if you want (in preferences).  Again be careful.  Not all miners support low fees; it may need a long time to get confirmed.

I.think this will end up being another orange green debate. No centralized answer.  I'm open to replacing cash on electron if something better comes along.
Was not aware of this. Holy smokes! Thx for posting.

This is why there can only be one Sith master.  Eventually the dark lords turn on each other.
he says this as if its news or something bad about it.  The whitepaper makes this clear from day 1.  
I think most of us here just want bigger blocks.  I haven't seen any "bitmain shill posts" per se.  Talk to me when this 'ant bleed' distraction thing boils over.  Right now there is a lot of noise going on.
if he's willing to burn down BCH, i'm sure he wouldn't hesitate to DDOS his own website.
The post seems to be talking about reclaiming provably unspent coins.  But here's the thing -- "reclaiming" coins is certainly NOT "the original protocol".  These kinds of willy-nilly changes are the exact opposite of "locking down the protocol".  Who knows what he will change next?  
He said he was building a mining pool to stop segwit

He said he was bringing big companies to use the bch chain

He said that he was providing a fungibility solution based on blind threshold signatures

He said he was providing novel technology based on oblivious transfers

He said he was providing a method where people could do atomic swaps without using timelocks

He said he was going to show everyone how we can do bilinear pairings on ecdsa.

He said he was going to release source code for nakasendo

He said he was releasing some information that would kill the lightning network 

He said he was going to show everyone how the selfish mining theory is wrong

He said he was going to show everyone how we can tokenize everything in the universe squared

also didn't he say a few times "big things are coming in (insert current month+2) "?
Growing pains.
for every one person posting this kind of awakening, there's probably 10 people waking up who aren't sharing their revelation.
Blinded signatures.The math is beyond me, but I know that some very smart people are working on it and it is truly some next level stuff.  I think May is when Dr. Wright plans to announce some things and probably this summer we'll have some tools.

I plan to improve the plugin functionality for Electron Cash so that things like CashShuffle can be plugged in without having to run the wallet from source, so that everyone can use it.  Eventually I think this will lead to a large portion of people using it, which will create a high level of fungibility.  
Genie cannot be put back in the bottle.  At best they can delay for a few years the rise of peer to peer electronic cash.  Even if they stop BCH, there's 1000 other coins.  And I think they realize this, which is why they are desperate to try to CONTROL it... make people interested in Bitcoin the investment not the currency...but all it will do is bring attention to it.  There's billions of poor and unbanked that will be using p2p cash.  It's the end of an era in the grand scheme of things.  Elitism will die and in its place, a golden age of prosperity for all.
wow.  what a bunch of scumbags.

Yeah anything you don't like can be claimed to be "disruptive".  

How about we start accusing Greg and core of computer fraud for turning off bits 6 and 8 to split the network since they are disrupting the agreed upon 2MB upgrade that 90% of the ecosystem wants?
screw LBC.  I hope you never get any more business.  
Spv works EXACTLY as per the white paper description.  And it is secure.

This is an unimpressive appeal-to-extremes fallacy.

At least when Peter Todd did it, he remembered to cloak his sophistry inside computer science lingo.  It's an O(n) system!

Edit: Check out u/JerryGallow comment below.  Hilarious
of course he's not on board.  Could you imagine one of the most famous establishment-friendly companies in the world supporting real p2p electronic cash?
More important: he is behaving the opposite of how most people believe satoshi would act. Saying bitcoin is not permissionless money , that it doesnt need to be decentralized...that he will be more ruthless than Mao and stalin...that if you dare disagree he will sue you, bankrupt you...wants to patent everything, wants permissioned mining, wants to steal coins, plagiarized papers, etc
upvoting...not to "villianize" the man, but anyone controlling this much BCH hash needs to be accountable for what they say.

Good find!  Can anyone from nChain explain this?  It certainly does not make any sense given their hardline stance on restoring the protocol.
Let Peter continue to destroy BTC.  Bitcion (BCH) lives on.
I see both sides of the argument.  I think its great that BCF is so transparent and publishes all of their information.

But when I look at that information, I see about $25k a month going to "human resources" which is the bulk of the spend.  

The most valuable thing (imo) that BCF does is to help meetup groups.  But those groups don't actually get that much money.

I think the work the BCF does is good, but I also think the scrutiny on them is good too.  Maybe it will make them more efficient or encourage competition.
the funny thing is : given how unstable zimbabwe fiat is, one of the most likely scenarios is that businesses will adopt anyway and bribe the regulators in bitcoin

I almost feel relieved.  Things make more sense now.  

Would not be surprised in the slightest if Greg was connected to the recent attacks on Electron.  These kind of people must be feeling especially upset with all the great things going on in Bitcoin Cash like Gigablock testnets, and 4 independent, solid development teams running full node implementations.
Gavin already tested with big blocks.  I'm so sick of this liar Adam Back.
I am most bullish on BCHD.
got my popcorn here. any link?  
>How did a contentious change like RBF get through while a blocksize increase did not?

You think that's bad?  What about the activation of Segwit?  It was so insane that the only way I could describe it was with this Pizza story allegory:

https://hackernoon.com/chapter-one-alice-and-bob-9fa315aeef62
Sorry I don't respect his decision.  He has demonstrated lack of integrity and courage...supposedly "helping the worlds' unbanked" was one of his big visions for Bitcoin, and when core ruined that due to high fees he said nothing and became an apologist for the core roadmap. 
CONFIRMED: Electron Cash 2.9.4 following the chain with the new rules! :)

(Old ABC 0.15 nodes stock on block 504031)
There is testing and reviewable proposals if you read the mailing list.  Go back to blockstream Greg.  Keep working on making me richer. thanks.
Ethereum quadrupled in the last 60 days.
i can see it just fine.
Great article.  Blockstream conspiracy going mainstream.  This won't end well for you, BTC.
Still needs peer review.  waiting for someone to poke a serious hole in the basic idea.  

Also thanks to the reddit users   who inspired this.  One person asked about how we could do on chain betting...another person later asked about gaming lobby.  This combines both of those ideas.
here's another perspective: which one of them has invested their own money to help the BCH ecosystem, and which one of them created a scam premine fork to enrich themselves?
why do I sometimes get the feeling that the bitcoin core roadmap is like one big joke that I'm not in on.  Like all these guys KNOW it won't work, that its ridiculous...and they still promote it.
i would not be surprised if someone bought the cobra account
Most likely the minority chain is someone trying to get attention. "They" want you to think hard forks on large networks are dangerous.

We cannot be afraid of some clown creating a shitcoin every time we want to upgrade the Bitcoin Cash network. If exchanges want to list a minority chain with zero community or developers and invite their customers to trade shitcoins, no one can stop them.

"Block reward subsidies will run out in the future so we'll need to rely on fees"... so lets make the fees super high **now**, which will kill growth of the userbase that pays fees in the future instead of continuing to build the network effect.

...or...

fees might not be sufficient in the future, so lets move everything off chain so they'll be even less incentive

...or...

Segwit 2x is bad without replay because it imposes its will on users. Meanwhile i'm going to do my best to prevent any on chain scaling
even though many users want it.

...or...

"contentious" hard forks are bad so lets do the most contentious softfork we can possibly do, even if it means the network will hardfork (twice)

...or...

"Segwit is the way", followed by "we didnt allow users to use Segwit in Core, and you shouldnt use Segwit until its 'burred' "

...or...

"centralization is bad" , but lets force users off the chain so they'll be forced to use centralized services instead of Bitcoin

...or... 

"I propose privacy schemes like coinjoin" but no one will use it because the fees are too high and confirmations too slow thanks to the fee market i wanted.

...I could probably think of more, but ...






it wont grow infinitely.  Instead, people will simply stop using Bitcoin.
The security audit is done.  We'll be releasing the audit publicly and the release of Electron Cash this week.  Bitcoin.com wallet is under development.
that awkward moment when everyone realizes the hatred toward BCH is obviously manufactured
>Still waiting on /u/jonald_fyookball to address the blatant lie that he was censored from bchchat. But that won't stop this subreddit from mass upvoting any bullshit that this guy spews.

Here's your blatant lie exposed, troll.
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9a8vtx/craig_wright_is_practicing_censorship_on/
They built private blocks with non mempool tx and tried to broadcast them. That is pretty silly by itself. If you do this you cant take advantage of compact blocks or graphene. CTOR makes graphene 7x better.  ABC/BU arent there yet but at least know where they are going.  
Lightning is a huge step backwards toward putting money back into governments and banks, instead of peer to peer cash.  I have several articles about this.  Here is the most recent:

https://www.yours.org/content/clarifying-my-objections-to-the-lightning-network-2f9d3aa154e5



Wait, so if they can sue Roger for claiming BCH is Bitcoin,  why can't I sue ( whoever) for claiming BTC is Bitcoin? 
the long term impact of trolls won't mean much. a lot of people laughed at ethereum and look at it now.
Ok bad news, market crashed.  Good news: BCH had a big pump before the crash and still has a better bch btc ratio than last week. Plus at this point I think more people are figuring out the value purchase is bch not btc.
$1 was never a good prediction. Only tone vays said that. I think some expected it might have bottomed at $25 though 
so....blockstream is lying?  Really, flat earth theory is used today as a cognitive dissonance technique which works like this:  Promote an obviously false idea (flat earth) and then associate it with other true conspiracies to discredit them.  You can see it happening in this thread as the trolls (who probably planted the post) point to it, and say "see, I told you r/btc is crazy!  The AXA stuff must be garbage too."
 
Very nice work Diane. So if I understand correctly, in this model, 1.4 million bitcoins are needed by the entire network, each user needs 14 open channels, and each user can send only 0.01 BTC maximum through a payment route? Also, if I understand correctly, the routing time considerations I wrote about were not modeled.

**To me, the fact that 14 open channels are required re-affirms the point that it’s not a “decentralized scaling solution”** since it requires doling out one’s spending money into 14 different buckets, precluding larger payments in most cases.
excellent....and I think this (October) is enough time to coordinate this.  Let's do it!  EDIT:  Peter, will you be also submitting a BIP?  It seems redundant to prove the BIP process is censored but perhaps worthwhile.
good cop bad cop routine.  luke jr is the bad cop who wants 300kb blocks and gregory is the good cop who will save us all with 1.7 segwit.  The really insane part is people discussing his post as if it wasn't batshit crazy.

Excellent.  This could be big news for Bitcoin Cash if people start using the BCH DEX.
Great video. 

I'm not sure how easy it is to simply ignore Mr. Wanker, for a few reasons.

a) It is human nature to squeeze the emotional juice of anything dramatic, controversial, outrageous, etc.  Or in other words, its simply entertaining, and people go on social media to be entertained.

b) Misinformation must be corrected or it tends to propagate.

c) Mr. Wanker has managed to get a hold of quite a few petahashes and is already making a bit of mess (with other people's money of course)


A story you might find interesting.  When I was writing the dice roll gist for ChainBet, I wanted to mathematically describe why we could use a remainder.  I more or less had it written correctly but wasn't sure about the math syntax.  So I asked Craig.. this was of course, during the time when I still was under the illusion he had math skills.  He was unable to give me an answer, and told me to "google Chinese remainder theorem".  wtf?  I ended up getting some guidance from someone else who actually knows math, and so was able to write my idea correctly.

The actual Luke junior account is about as pro trollish as it gets. (He can't possibly believe his own bs). The cobra account is far more logical. Maybe he need some outlet to say something that actually made sense.
they wont be listed on bitcoincash.org if they dont change it quickly.  someone should let them know that.   
Yeah I love all these arguments "why not litecoin".  Obviously they are scared of the huge competition from the true honey badger. And they should be.
a scam BTG wallet, apparently with my name affixed to it. (lovely)
Just a normal retracement.  Nothing whatsoever to do with the 2x upgrade that we tried so hard to see fail.  Nothing to do with Bitcoin Cash exploding.  Nothing to see here.   
right.  if segwit was so great, why is no one using it?
Look at the semantics and rhetoric from the twitter trolls, splitting hairs over whether bitpay "represents users" or "serves users".  Listen morons, the point is that the users aren't happy with the high fees.  Get it?

LN may kill ~~bitcoin~~ BTC

FTFY
Really important this idea.  Would like to see it developed more. What is the new n.e. and how does it lead to rent seeking where the old one doesn't? I think it has to do with the fact that there's a liquidity constraints.  I will think more on it too.
In his own words: " I have never stated any support whatsoever for the BCH fork."
Just another "layer".  Doesn't replace lightning as there's nothing here that can form a network (let channels borrow from other channels).  The section 5.2 "extending the protocol to other parties" just means you can have more than 2 parties in the channel; it doesn't mean you link different channels together the way LN tries to do.  

As others have pointed out, this won't solve the biggest problem of LN , which is liquidity/routing.  
try Evercoin.

Btw, I think advertising as "no account needed" and then asking for KYC info is false advertising and fraud.

Wait you guys are actually engineering efficiency? That's impossible.  Everyone knows we're a bunch of amateurs and the only thing we can do is just increase a blocksize variable.  Obviously ONLY Core is remotely qualified to create technological approaches!  All hail Core!  1MB4EVER!
I would somewhat agree.   Hashing functions can be substituted without effecting the overall operation, functionality, and economics of Bitcoin.

Greg is wrong about other things that are far more important.  


Trolls can argue all day long. Nobody cares.  Use the solution you prefer 
I would work on merchant adoption.
Holy fuck.  This is really huge news and they got sloppy to do this.  

1.  Trustnodes has been getting press lately and is speaking the truth.
If they suddenly change their tune, we'll know what happened.

2.  Did you notice a veiled threat in addition to the bribe?

3.  If they are doing this much publicly, just imagine what they've been doing privately... It makes sense why Charlie Shrem, Erik Vorhees, Thomas V, and a whole bunch of other people back the core roadmap.

>In the short term, Lightning should reduce on-chain fees significantly. Essentially they become subscription fees to use Bitcoin, rather than per-transaction fees.

QFR.

Surprised to hear you admit this.  You don't see that as bad -- that an individual has to subscribe (with permission) to someone's service to use Bitcoin?

I take a view somewhere in the middle.  "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent" is a famous quote among traders.  Long term, value always wins , but the long term can be longer than anyone thinks.  I have a few ideas that will be coming in an article to explain why BTC is so high and what can happen.
Adam, I know its your job to be a liar and a spin doctor... but you're not doing an especially good job at it. How is it possible to logically claim that Roger is blocking segwit while simultaneously claiming you aren't blocking bigger blocks?
Thanks for your work on this!  Cool to see CTOR in action.
Forget hodlnaut... what about the litigation aimed at open source software developers (in this case ABC).   **THAT** is a much better reason to support the #DelistBSV idea.  

Also, CZ, Bitcoin Cash community isn't bad.  We just want p2p electronic cash as mentioned in the Bitcoin whitepaper.  Please change our ticker to BCH.
Electron Cash won't allow the user to shoot themselves like this btw.
Bitpay didn't penalize anyone with excessive fees... the BTC chain did that on its own just fine because of the small blocks.  And please get a new handle.  You're not Roger Ver.
No, this idea won't work and we need to push cash shuffle development along instead.

The reason it won't work is that blockchain analysis will still show 100% of the same taint from your own coins even if you have divided them up into smaller pieces.  What's needed is to blend them with others' coins.

EDIT: Based on comments here, I see this has value in 'pre-taint' and balance privacy, although does not help with untainting and fungibility in the normal sense. 

Good post.  Btw, malleability was never really a "bug" and Segwit doesn't even really "fix" it since you dont have to use Segwit.  BCH is doing fine with no segwit, no LN, no mal fix, just good ol Bitcoin ;)
maybe they just stole the template from electroncash.org and plan to remove my name later, but for the record, i have nothing to do with this software or with bitcoin gold at all

The community as a whole will not give btc ticket to a minority fork.  If they do, it will quickly become a joke. A bitcoin in name only in every sense. It is too big a financial risk.
2x is happening, Core is getting fired, and Blockstream will be relegated to irrelevant status and put into the bitcoin hall of shame.
here's my tinfoil hat theory:  At some point AXA and DCG were on the same page.  They both invested in Blockstream and knew BSCore would slow down Bitcoin.  DCG wanted to profit from BS's LN and also from altcoins.  AXA just wants to go full settlement layer, no matter what.    

At this point, the factions are dividing.  DCG thinks this is gone on far enough, we need to do 2x to keep BTC usable.  AXA and BScore doesnt want BTC usable.  They want the settlement coin.   Plus DCG doesnt believe BS will deliver any profits.

so now BSCore and DCG aren't getting along.  
Charles tweeted it, and Roger posted the tweet on reddit. i dont see what the big deal is in that.
We knew ln was bunk years ago. But i dont think we won yet.
Its good to see you keep posting about this.  I contributed some docs to your project.  Haven't seen what else is going on.
If SV doesnt value privacy and fungibility, thats fine. No skin off my back.
I don't know what ABC's plan is regarding malleability in the future, but I do not support malleability fixes that require a segregated signature.
>lasting contribution to the broader understanding of mankind
 
I really wonder how you convince yourself that preventing the growth and usage of BTC as peer to peer money was a contribution to mankind.

I will pray for you. 
Wow that would be 2.4 years worth of full gigabyte blocks.
I think about 12 months... There are several things going on right now at the same time.  First, Dr. Wright promised fungibility solutions coming in May.  So we'll see.

Second, there is the BLS discussion:

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-ml/2018-April/000702.html

Chia is working on a curve selection, so BCH devs want to see what comes out of that.  

Third, Cash Shuffle group is working to make their solutions more adoptable and user friendly.




Mark Cuban would be all over bitcoin cash if he understood it's history and trajectory.
very unrealistic to hope that the EDA is going to put Bitcoin core into a death spiral, even with a 2x split.  We have to focus on what is best for Bitcoin Cash, not try to kill core, which is unlikely to happen and would be bad for everyone in crypto if it did.
It's a "requirement" as per the WP, and as  far as having the digital signature there to validate the chain of ownership.  Is that not important?  Or is it only important when you want to tell people that miners are going to validate Segwit tx?

No, it just needs a witness id... if you run an old software version, it will see the blocks as having no signatures, that's what the SF was all about.  You know that.   

Afaik, I never "advanced myself as an expert".  Projection maybe?  

I can sense you are upset Greg.  Maybe you need a vacation.
The distinction is simple.  They want to move small purchases off the blockchain and use netting and third parties to settle.
Thank you for proving one of the points in the article that the attacks on Bitcoin Cash are of a dishonest nature.  "$20k" nodes as mentioned by CSW are for a machine that does 500k sigops/sec.  Do you know how big the Bitcoin network will be at that time?  Also at that time , the cost of that machine will be far less than 20k.  Bitmain is a company that makes mining gear.  How exactly is it going to be a peer->Bitmain network? wut??  Top down governnance? huh??  Obviously its not supposed to make any sense but rather confuse the new reader.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bullshit.  Good work.
the tweet was deleted, thankfully someone got the archive:

great work spearheading adoption in Africa and around the world with pizza :)
is there a public testnet?
No one is pushing for 1 minute blocks.  It was maybe an idea that some Chinese people liked at some point, but hasn't been discussed seriously ever as a proposal.

Also, Bitmain has been asking a LONG time for tokens... nChain/Coingeek could not solve tokens even with a 5m pound bounty..it was only after GROUP failed to get consensus that everyone started agressively solving tokens with Cryptonize it, SLP, and Wormhole.    Wormhole is just one proposal for tokens and far from the top priority for Bitmain, who is investing in tons of projects to help crypto adoption such as $50M in Opera.  

Craig, I think its time we all stop attacking each other and focus on a unified roadmap for BCH.  Opcodes, fine.. but we also need optimization of canonical ordering or at least remove topological ordering; otherwise the 128mb idea doesn't even make sense.
Long term bullish yes. A lot of things are building built on bch. Bitmain very committed to bch. Short term bitmain probably has too much supply and we are in the pain trade. Just hodl.
Yep. We're in building mode.  We want to make this available asap.if enough people are interested maybe I can blog about the dev process as we go on yours.  
Things like Iota and Nano which claim security with no security incentives (no inflation and no fees) sound too good to be true, probably because they are.

At best they are efficient proof of stake systems and do not replace sound money of Bitcoin.


its not hypocrisy.  Its simple.  BTC = good.  BCH = bad.

Security audit is expected to take about 2 weeks from what I hear.   After its done, we'll release it quickly (within a few days).  The Bitcoin.com wallet is being developed.
Suppose for the sake of argument that its true: Dave Kleinmen and Phil Wilson were mostly responsible for Bitcoin and CSW was sort of "in the room when it happened", or at best we can say he was a small part of the Satoshi group.

So freakin what?  

Does that make CSW any less incompetent or toxic than he's demonstrated himself to be?  Does it make up for the fact that he was caught red-handed plagiarizing?  Does it make up for the fact that he apparently didn't understand basic things like Base58 or address checksums?  

No, it doesn't.  So who cares?  Maybe Dave Kleiman *was* Satoshi.  Just because Craig is a knucklehead doesn't mean he wasn't.

He's supporting people that are literally threatening the network and have already caused billions of dollars capital loss to the entire sector. 
that's not what i'm trying to do at all.  CSW did massive damage.  He won in that sense.
He wants a low bch price. That way there's less relative btc miners and he has a better chance of doing 51% attacks on bitcoin cash.  Just speculation of course on my part but if true (and its certainly plausible) , then its quite sad.
These cartoon animation marketing videos aren't cheap to produce.  I wonder who is spending thousands of dollars to "make sure everyone knows the truth"... hmmmm
Great job.  I'm curious why BU still publishies a non bitcoin cash version.
Consider me also in the dedicated to bitcoin for Life Club
The initial thought and proposal was to make it mandatory via orphaning.  However, the conclusion of the meeting was to implement voluntarily to start with and go from there.  

I don't think there is any reason to believe that things will go from voluntary to compulsory quickly because that would require high quality software to be developed for this purpose, which does not happen overnight.

As far as the economics of compulsory funding, I think the greatest risk is that the users will feel this is too great of a departure from the classic bitcoin set up.... which does concern me.  In addition, if Bitcoin miners change the classic rules via Nakamoto Consensus, there will be a larger concern that later they might decide to change other rules...even the 21M limit.  Even though it would not be credible, this narrative will be promoted heavily by the competition.  

I'm hoping we don't need to.  I wrote a piece on why we might not need to:

https://www.yours.org/content/how-bitcoin-cash-miners-can-sustainably-fund-ecosystem-development-wit-1c9e35ff2a6a
>  I'm simply pointing out that Bitcoin is processing way more transactions that BCH and that raising the limit does not magically raise demand, even though some people seem to think this.

Nobody thinks that.  Raising the limits ensures that we have ample headroom.  Not a tremendously complicated idea to grasp.
yes, he never bashed it which is good.  And shapeshift did add it pretty quickly. I'll give him that.  

Maybe its a little pretentious to believe everyone should strongly support BCH. I guess I was expecting a little more from an early adopter.
The cycle goes like this:  Fees get stupidly high , so Bitcoin becomes essentially unusable... Then people stop using it... Then fees go down... eventually people forget the fee insanity and start using Bitcoin again, the network gets congested, and fees go high again.  

Rinse and repeat... It's long-term unreliable, and the network really doesn't grow its userbase.
The attitude of core is wanting to control everything. It's the opposite of what it's supposed to be about

LN won't be decentralized.  It will require large centralized hubs to do anything useful, at least as a scaling mechanism.
If this is your sincere belief, then you still don't understand Bitcoin.  Perhaps you should read my [recent article on SPV security](https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/why-every-bitcoin-user-should-understand-spv-security-520d1d45e0b9).   When taken to extremes, the "trust no one" idea falls apart, because using Bitcoin requires you trust the network.  
So what, Greg?  Why nitpick over the fact that he incorrectly labeled Ethereum's flexible gas limits as EC instead of more accurately describing them as 'dynamic limits' or whatever you want to call it.  You're avoiding the most important point which is that all of the successful altcoins are freely scaling on chain.  None of them are stuck in the quagmire that Bitcoin's in. As one of the leaders of the core development team,  don't you think you should focus on solving this issue?    Does anyone in Core have any diplomatic skills? Or are you guys only capable of publishing your roadmap and just demanding everyone follow it?  Or maybe you really just want full blocks and second layers at any cost, even if it means stalemate/stagnation?  You won't address these topics that are raised but you love to chime in to correct people... It's really frustrating bro.
I remember everyone hating on Hearn and I was saying "well, Hearn has said some dumb things in the past but he's making more sense than the core devs right now"...and people just not getting it.
What's with this testnet stuff I see in your screenshot?  Mainnet or go home :)  No but seriously, good work on Cash Shuffle.  It's indeed coming soon!~
Yes and no.  Yes it would be enough simply to be a widely accepted payment and that is the end goal, but that goal is difficult.  So, we should be doing other things as much as possible to support and supplement that.  Also, not every dev is going to go out and solicit merchants, so let the devs build things on BCH.  This is why I said the *dev* community should do this.  The non technical people should focus on adoption :)
I think the framework should be developed but not activated in consensus. 
 Fractional satoshis would allow an incredible utxo bloat attack vector. Although I'm sure the protocol devs know this.
he also said Pow can't be deserted; this seems like a spin on what he really meant to say.
Electron Cash implements the full SPV security model and is SPV per whitepaper except querying servers rather than nodes directly. It trades some privacy for convenience in subscribing to addresses rather than using bloom filtets, allowing HD wallets to be be instantly restored from seed .
liquidity bot was running well earlier today, it seems to have stopped, but hoping this can be stable very soon.

Yep.  Moving the goal posts is one of their favorite tactics.  When I wrote this:

https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800

It was heavily attacked.

Now, the narrative has shifted to:  Well, there may be some heavily connected nodes, but its ok because ___ reasons.
sounds like a good direction for Cobra with the new whitepaper.  Bitcoin: A User Activated Electronic Banking System
....annnnnd this is why Bitcoin is proof of work, not proof of twitt.
ohh boy. things are going to get interesting.
All your fancy satellites won't convince me to trade in my peer to peer cash for your high-fee bankster run settlement network.  This feels like its in the same category of "can we just buy Jihan dinner and nice bottle of wine instead of 2MB" lol
I fully support Luke Jr
email them and explain there's another project called bcash not to be confused with bitcoin cash and they are acting like asshats
Their choice.  I won't be using them anymore since I will be using bitcoin Cash.  
lol has this guy not heard of Blockstream?
i am one of the people that get it and think the speech was awesome.
Hilarious.   I posted an article saying that Core supporters intimidate businesses, Bitpay retweets it, and Core supporter proves my point by trying to intimidate Bitpay  
Well, I respect your opinion.  To me, Blockstream is public enemy number one.  Maybe that sounds extremist/fanatical but lets look at the facts:  They've taken $70M in VC from AXA (and others), they are developing scaling solutions (LN), they employ or have employed several of the most prominent core developers, many of which had somewhat balanced opinions on the blocksize, and now all advocate for small blocks, and most say that high fees are good for Bitcoin.  I'm surprised that I have to spell this all out.  I'm not sure which part of this you disagree with.
Greg, are you obsessed with "bcash"?  It's kind of interesting that the author of the Core roadmap is here posting more than anyone else.   
It would be a short-term setback for crypto but it could backfire big-time as people start asking why the government doesn't want you to have this. Basically they would be doing our job for us and educating the world about sound money. This is why most jurisdictions have not banned it. They would rather just make it hard to use and have the average person believe the government is not afraid of it. That is why we saw the attacks from blockstream and N chain
https://i.imgflip.com/2itbef.jpg
u/vbuterin interesting.  So is this something SPV clients would be doing for each and every block?

Btw, I've been talking to some developers on full node implementations (Bitprim and BU) about implementing the ElectrumX protocol as part of the full node bitcoin software, which doesn't seem that hard if its basically just RPC messages... this would give the BCH network much more nodes to connect to through Electron Cash, which is a benefit by itself...it may be then possible to implement something like this fraud proof idea.
probably some kid in a bad mood because he bought at $15k and the price hasn't recovered..plus he's out of weed and feeling really salty today.
u/tippr $1
blatantly deceptive.   
i doubt BCH will split.  Winner takes all.  No one will start an alt coin.
The biggest difference between LTC and BCH imo is the community.  BCH has a global community with a burning desire to succeed, the support of some of the biggest companies like Bitpay, people with lots of money, people with lots of drive, people with lots of heart.   

LTC community is luke warm at best by comparison.  
Surprise bonus: you can't do this on BTC!  (read the post to see why).
 
hashrate follows price so makes sense since bch/btc is rising
>The concept of "fee estimation" only makes sense for a congested network. If Bitcoin Cash ever needs fee estimation, it will be broken again, like Bitcoin Core is now,

Exaclty. This isn't complicated!  Forget fee estimation and just set your fees based on miner policy which I think is 1 sat/byte.  We set ours to 2 sat/byte on electron cash just to be sure. 
yes because the blocks are 8 times bigger and will keep increasing in size.  They are not designed to be full.  The BTC core devs chose to have full blocks on purpose because they want a 2-layer design (lightning network).
funny these people are saying "well if he just used a segwit wallet" **facepalm**
it will morph into some weird new state where you still hve the keys but your funds are held at the lightning hub with timelocks.  it will be too expensive to actually move your stuff to another "bank" or do anything on chain. so you send 1tx and you still have your key but your funds are in the hub.  have fun kids
Biased is not strong enough a word if one token can go to zero. More like fake, fraud, lie, double standard, deception etc 
Good work achow but i think these still can be exploited per the attack.  We really don't care anymore -- ABC patches the attack.

Btw, I am starting to think this whole thing was a bit of the "clearly I can not choose the wine in front of you"... Core knew ABC was patching, so had bitclub play some pranks which could have plausible deniability in the form of large signatures as well as trolling effects.
DCG invested in Blockstream and as well as Coindesk, which more or less supports the core roadmap.  Not too late to redeem yourself Barry!
Larger blocks do not create centralization.  In fact, the opposite happens.  Large blocks mean that lots of users are transacting.  As the number of transactions grows linearly, the cost of running a mining node also increases linearly, but the value of the network grows **exponentially**.  This is called the network effect.  

Therefore, yes it will become more expensive to run a mining node, but also much more profitable.  In addition, storage, bandwidth, and processing keeps getting cheaper.
Greg knows everything about everything.  Peter must be wrong. /s
It's simple:  Those that do the most good become the biggest targets for attack.  
good example of when the debate was about 2 vs 4 vs 8 mb.  Then, it became "we dont have consensus"... then it became "HF are bad"...then it became "we have this great thing to avoid a HF , its called segwit".
Nice to see the smaller pools GBMiner and Canoe supporting BU.  
>Don't get me wrong. I'm happy with the outcome here but it came about for all the wrong reasons
 
Agree, but its still a huge victory for us; I don't think everyone has grasped just how big.

Bitcoin Cash had all the momentum before the fork...we were THE p2p cash version of Bitcoin.  The SV fork cast a shadow of doubt on that as well the viability of bitcoin minority forks in general.  ("They'll just keep forking, etc").

Now with BSV discredited, it casts BCH in a new light (.e.g "Oh, BCH was the truth the whole time", "forking as a way to upgrade DOES work", "There was never a real community split, it was just an attack from craig") etc.

Iow, BSV was a huge attack that set back BCH.  That attack (and the attackers) are now going to be seen for what it is.  This helps BCH tremendously and reaffirms BCH in pole position to become global p2p cash, even if that wasn't CZ's intention (and I'm sure it wasn't).
Thanks for the summary.  I'd like to point out that it literally doesn't "spend to cashshuffle and return back".  A cashshuffle transaction is a singular transaction and it is only the correct version of the transaction that will be signed by the wallet, which makes it trustless.
The main point for me was the no-HF policy on BTC makes deploying Schnorr a longer process.  Is that not essentially true?
the security team is moving a bit slower than we wanted but i think it will be worth the wait.
amazing job!
Funny all the troll comments here and on twitter. 
The point is you shouldn't need anyone's permission to send money, the government or anyone else's.  And with Bitcoin, you don't.
someone asked for an organized list of my articles.  here it is.  enjoy
Honestly the whole wormhole conspiracy is a big waste of time and a distraction from working on adoption.  Wormhole exists because it doesn't require a protocol change.  It's a non-issue.
Meeting is today and didn't start yet. Not sure who was at the meeting yesterday.
> is there any chance that you might be putting your personal interest ahead of Bitcoin and science/data?

The opposite is true; I am risking losing the Electron Cash funding from Coingeek if they see me not aligned with their interests.  I can only hope that they see my intentions toward Bitcoin are pure; I do not change my opinions automatically to fall in line with Craig's if I do not agree.  I did not answer your previous post because it was buried deep in comments but no I had not seen it.  As I recently said, I am beginning to think it would be safer to just remove topological ordering first.  I have no deal with Haipo and no talks of any deal...sure are a lot of rumors flying around.  If Haipo wants to award his token contest to the SLP team, that is great but nothing was said one way or the other about it.  And even if that happens, SLP is completely agnostic to protocol changes.
Cryptonize it is a rebirth of the Colu protocol; SLP is a new protocol.  Both are UTXO OP RETURN based systems, so they are pretty similar.  But SLP was designed to be simpler, and thus more robust, more fault tolerant, easier to understand, and easier to implement in light wallets.  

Currently we have the SPV wallet supporting it.

If they wont be needing bitcoin.org I'll offer to buy it.
resident troll bitusher going nuts in this thread in damage control mode. lmao
sounds like a whole lotta FUD to me.  Miners are not going to run out of memory... If they can't handle a 32 mb block for some reason, they'll just mine a a few 8mb blocks.
Yes the size is huge by today's standards but it can be done and will be ok for global currency.  Consider that gigabit internet speed is already here for home users.

decentralized bitcoin is the one with big blocks, not the one with crippled capacity so blockstream can run their patented sidechains 
You accusing anyone of spin and propaganda is pretty funny.  To answer your question, There are always trade-offs but your false assumptions are skewing it in unreasonable ways to support your agenda.    I took a look at the drivechain page.  This idea of creating secondary markets: "Investment-banker-types will buy your side-BTC with their main-BTC, at competitive rates" on top of Bitcoin violates the P2P cash ideals of Bitcoin and is basically the same Bitcoin-as-a-settlement-network.  If you're all about 'respecting other people's perspectives' you should let onchain and offchain compete freely.  Btw, People aren't ignoring me.  My articles are being translated into multiple languges and I've already earned the status of "top writer" in medium for Bitcoin.  It's not that I'm so smart, but reality is a potent weapon when wielded correctly.
   
Tone Vays, thank you for revealing to the world what a dishonest low life piece of shit you are.
I'm sure Erik has a nice basket of cryptos, so he doesn't really care TOO much if Bitcoin fails. He just got $10M from investors, including DCG, who also owns a piece of Blockstream.  Erik seems like a great guy, but at this point his opinion about Bitcoin scaling should be considered 100% corrupted.  Actually, what we should do, is accept his previous statement (before he became unduly influenced), that now is the appropriate time to fork away from Core.  Thank you Erik for saying this.  
...as usual, a den of trolls with very weak arguments flock to roger's tweets like moths to a flame.
Miners should strive for a consistent fee policy across the ecosystem to improve reliabilty of 0 conf.

I dont see why we wouldnt or couldnt go below 1000 sats/kb when the price of bitcoin cash goes to the moon.
Of course the BTC maximalists will say that because full SPV fraud proofs haven't been developed (which were mentioned in the whitepaper as a **side point**) , then the entire section 8 doesn't apply, and thus SPV isn't secure or safe.


that's just the footer, not part of the official statement lol
Release notes here: 

https://github.com/Electron-Cash/Electron-Cash/releases

Most of the work done by Calin Culianu.  I'm most excited about the addition of libsecp256k1, which makes signing MUCH faster especially with transactions containing a large number of inputs.  

Please note we bumped the checkpoints past the recent fork upgrade, so if you want to split your BSV coins, you should use previous version 3.3.2.
Fully agree with you.
You see it too? He is making bad karmic choices.

I think he started with good intentions to "balance things out" and now as the only one left with Craig, he probably feels trapped, maybe both financially and fear of retribution of some kind if he engages in betrayal of the predator.

My advice to Ryan is stop the shilling, slowly back away... its not too late for you.  Please redeem yourself.
Rawpool has never said anything indicating support for SV. Why do the shills keep saying they do?
hi Andrew,

Thanks for this article; I think this is a healthy discussion to have.
I may be out of my depth with some of the details here but I 
would like to understand this more.

Could there be a bit of apples and oranges comparison here?  Your
argument  that "If this sharding scheme can handle 
the validation routing load, it can handle the top level 
routing of unsorted transactions" seems to be simply comparing the number
of messages, but you also say "the scaling advantage that 
CTOR offers is that it is easy to break the block up 
and pass transactions to shards" which is a qualitative difference.

More generally, I think sharding may not necessarily be the main
motivation for CTOR but rather improving validation and block propagation.
 

Do you mean the SV client or the general idea of satoshi nakamoto whitepaper?  I find the lack of distinction between the two very confusing, perhaps done intentionally by some.  Bitcoin ABC, BU,XT all support bitcoin peer to peer electronic cash which is the same vision of sn. Equating the SV client w the concept is a politically expedient ambiguity. 
use some critical thinking here... WHY is Greg defending him?  1. he hates CSW.  2. he wants to divide and conquer.    

The "oh Greg likes Amaury, Greg is bad so Amaury must be bad" is the wrong way to think about it and is your confirmation bias.  

Both Amaury and CSW contribute.  Let's stop feeding the drama.

He would think jumping off a bridge was a good idea if btc devs told him to.
which one do you doubt?  The first two are documented, the second is a deduction based on the fact that practically every single person who supports BCH has been socially attacked.
correct.  but no one ever said the masses are informed.
Instead of giving money to organizations, people can now give money directly to merchants. #bchpizza
The nature of the "game" allows it.  No doubt very smart people on "both" sides of the battle have noted this and 6 chess moves beyond.  Winning will boil down to skillful execution not information per se. Kind of like asking why cant everyone be a chess grandmaster since there's thousands of books and videos with all the information you could ever want.
There's an inverse relationship between anything Luke Jr says and the truth.
you can usually get a discount by negotiating for remnant space.    ...and I would like to take a crack at writing that full page ad.
no one will ever use this complicated mess. Why would they when its 10x easier to just use another coin? 
Sorry core no blocksize for you now. Scaling happens on bch.
jedi mind tricks only work on the weak minded. unfortunatley that is a large  percentage of the population 
I'm guessing he's afraid of backlash from powerful interests that support Core.  If this is not the case u/evoorhees and there is another reason for you not to publicly support BCH, lets hear it :)
agree completely, hence the link i pasted.   So where are all the disgruntled devs now that a consensus process proposal has been suggested by singularity?  Funny there is 10 times as much complaining as there is actually focusing on solutions...both in the process of governance and in the process of actually working on the Algo.   
so... ?  Pieter and Greg have some great ideas.  Turning Bitcoin from p2p cash into a settlement network isn't one of them.  
>It very well might.

Yeah very true. Most investors listen "to the street" and do not really understand the technology.   Segwit weakens security and doesn't provide anything of real value to users.

Good work on the Github, and you confirmed what I (and others) were thinking -- what the deuces is going here when its the MIT license and its used on every file?  

Apparently, it doesn't matter what the license actually says, because according to King Gregory, you must do some "special" attribution that meets the standards of his own personal opinions about the matter.

> My post filled with lots of links, evidence and arguments

Yes, and as chernobyl169 pointed out  "All those links depend on a falsehood: namely, that the "decentralization of Bitcoin" is dependent on "a diversity of fully validating but non-mining nodes"."

I also addressed this myth in my recent [letter to the miners](https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/an-open-letter-to-bitcoin-miners-c260467e1f0)
whats the record for 24 avg mempool ?  Maybe this?  I consider Blockstream to be a malicious actor.  Employing core devs and holding the code hostage for their own agenda that is starkly not aligned with anyone else in the community.

Great post Peter.  The LN fanboys seem like they're afraid to debate you. (I'm not surprised).  And maybe they are afraid of the truth :\
what did either Roger or Jihan ever do that were dishonest or corrupt?  
> Both sides are being led by liars who are trying to convince people that the longest chain of work has more importance than it actually does.

Not really...ABC was forced to play this stupid game to defend against 51% attack and also for PR reasons.  Not ALL exchanges are friendly to Bitcoin Cash.  There are some that aren't.


add SV servers manually

sv1.hsmiths.com

electroncash.cascharia.com
Yep.  Make them too big before the network is ready and refuse optimizations (CTOR, etc) that actually let the network handle it.
name calling isn't an argument
I applaud your generous attitude.  Since you seem like a reasonable person, I invite you to read one my articles which explains why I'm not a fan of the LN, even if it someday becomes user friendly:

https://www.yours.org/content/clarifying-my-objections-to-the-lightning-network-2f9d3aa154e5
There you have it folks. Proof bcash is a scam. /s
1. They are 2 completely different ledgers for starters.  If you spend BCH coins to a BTC address, the coins will move on the BCH ledger, not the BTC ledger.

2. If you accidentally do this, you can still recover the coins in most cases IF the receiver controls the private key.

3. Transactions do not "replay" across the networks (iow if you spend coins from a BCH address and also have coins in the same BTC address, the BTC coins won't be spent)

4. The main exception to #2 (not sure if there are others) is segwit P2SH addresses which cannot be redeemed on BCH because BCH doesnt know about segwit.

5. BCH has cashaddr encoding addresses ("cash addr") which are invalid encoding on all BTC wallets, preventing mistakes.

6. signatures are different, so a TX is slightly different, which is what prevents the replay.

7. most other parts of the protocol are compatible.


Yes but don't relax on adoption effort please.
Because Bitcoin was created as a peer to peer electronic cash system.  That means anyone in the world should be able to send money to anyone else in the world without permission, quickly and cheaply.

BTC changed all that by refusing to remove the 1mb limit which was supposed to be temporary.   They made it expensive to transact (fees hit $50 last year) and more important: prevented everyone from using it as cash.  ...Under the guise of "we need to develop second layers".

BCH wasn't having any of that and continued the project as was intended and expected by simply raising the blocksize.


agree. im not even saying sell it all..just dont put your eggs in one basket especially one with broken fundamentals.
Big news
nobody wanted SegShit until the Bilderburg Blockstream propaganda machine spent millions convincing people they did.  Will miners be smarter? Probably wishful thinking but let's find out.
no one ever said there would be a system crash.  We just said the invisible wall would be hit, fees would skyrocket, and users would leave.  Which is exactly what happened.
they do have tone vays.  he's pretty entertaining goofball.   it will be really amusing to watch at each step.  i cant wait to hear him say something like "i guess i was wrong about bitcoin cash" lol
LOVE THIS
>There are already a bunch of forgotten alts with "bitcoin" this-or-that in their names

Right, so you really have to wonder why Theymos and the gang are trying SO hard to call it something else.
ethereum doesn't have full blocks :) Nor a 4 year war behind its split.  If one version of Bitcoin doesn't allow cheap fast transactions, another will.  
DCG funded shapeshift CEO Erik Vorhees, the now good cop to the blockstream bad cop... back pedaling with Barry.... you're two years too late, my friend.  Fork is coming.
The reason why its so hard to buy Bitcoin is the reason everyone needs to buy it -- so we can escape the centralized fiat system and all the evil control the state forces on everyone.  
they will simply say that HF are bad.
Thanks for your generosity
>i'm actually impressed that he was able to infiltrate the BCHABC community like this.

There is no "BCHABC community".  There is the Bitcoin Cash community.  Only trolls ahem call it anything like what you're calling it.

But no, many people including myself strongly suspected he's gmax.  He didn't "infiltrate" us.  Although he did manage to exert a lot of his opinions on the direction of BTC, it would seem.
Good idea.  This will make companies think twice about accepting short term political points.  Attack BCH, and you are attacking p2p cash.  You are attacking Bitcoin and freedom.  This will go on your permanent record.
Its not a ponzi but at only 6 tx sec its a bet on lightning network which is a pretty bad bet considering how hard it is to use and that it requires an always-on full node.
>PSA: The worst they can do is deny service (not fwd tx's).

Or spy on your wallet history.


we have an alpha version that works pretty well in Electron Cash.  It's currently being tested and code reviewed and audited.
This is the exact same mentality that I believe many core/blockstream supporters have.  Make it establishment-friendly... even if that means completely compromising the permissionless nature of Bitcoin.

Whether it's permissioned mining or the Lightning Network, they want the same thing:  The promise of investing in a widely used currency with the scarcity of 21M units, but without it actually being Bitcoin the permissionless p2p cash that frees humanity.  

Yes.  This kind of strategy can work.  But exchanges and other nodes need to stay in sync. 
I've basically investigated it.  Small blockers are full of shit and responsible for holding back the greatest humanitarian project of all time.  This is documented in the many articles I've written. What else is there to say.
Well said.
Thanks for this comment. Thiis is the kind of discussion we need.  

Where did you get 0.5%? And why do you say that even though a block can be much smaller it doesn't save bandwidth on block propagation?  
The article never claims that that ABC invented the quadratic hashing fix.  Nor does it say the article is an exhaustive list of needed optimizations.  Nor does it fail to give credit to BU for the p2p message size.

You conclude by saying we should not support ABC, instead of showing a willingness to help them and collaborate.

My impression is that you have a chip on your shoulder when it comes to ABC and you deride them at every opportunity.  I am starting to understand why you have not been invited back to the Multi Group developer meetings... which is a shame because clearly you are a talented developer.
Here is a blog post about this very powerful (and also potentially dangerous) feature:

https://www.yours.org/content/electron-cash-introduces-easy-plugins--bff1686dcca2 

Also, version 3.3 is available on the google play store for android.  This will be likely the LAST version of the current android wallet; as such i've labelled it "Electron Cash Classic"... in the next 3 months or so we'll be coming out with a next generation Android wallet.  iOS is in beta and scheduled to come out in a week.  We also have a J2ME wallet which is a few short weeks away.

IMPORTANT: all SERVER operators should upgrade asap to newest protocol.  Otherwise, you will be losing clients and hindering protocol improvements!
99.99% of Electron Cash users won't need to upgrade.  That said, we are adding the op codes to the next release.  I think its only applicable if you import some advanced script.
I spoke to Bitpay somewhat recently about adding bip70 to Electron Cash.  Apparently there are security risks for them with 0-conf, although I don't know the details.
Already mentioned. See 'misled people'
Uh yeah. That's the whole point of what core is doing. 

Edit: there is some confusion here that this is actual a problem. Please see

Vitalik seems like a big blocker. Awesome!  How long before r/bitcoin starts dragging his name through the mud?
Yeah but it wont happen. nothing happens without ~~Greg Maxwell's approval~~ consensus.
I have multiples more BCH coins than BTC, so if there is a flippening, all I have to do, is do nothing.
thanks for your leadership Tom on pushing for the URI solution.  I think merchant adoption is one of the most important or perhaps the most important issues to tackle.
for those that don't get the troll, 2x agreement has HF within 6 months part of it.  Then again, everyone knew the HF part was probably a lie.  For everything else, there's Bitcoin Cash.
This is one of the main reasons "we" left.  Have fun competing with your high fees, Bitcoin Core! ~~EDIT:  This article is crap.  Rusty claims we'll need to grow capacity 75,000 times to support 100,000 users.  My calculations:  If Bitcoin supports 3 TPS, thats 259k tx /day.  100,000 users doing 10 tx a day is 1M, so we'll need to grow by a whopping factor of 4.   Not 75,000.  But what did you expect from a Blockstream employee?~~
they are desperate and scared and are making a futile attempt to change the name.
can we also maybe have sidechains with some fractional reserve issued tokens too?
>"segwit NOW. not after 4-6-9months"

very much Satoshi Vision! 
**Electron Cash will continue to function perfectly on either side of the fork.**
Yep this was agreed to be a good idea by all groups in London including nchain. I know because I was there. The idea is prevent easy fork like clashic.
i dont understand your concern.  There's been several viable token systems deployed recently all WITHOUT any change to the bitcoin protocol.
I assume he is talking about other ways that transactions can be either organized so that parallel validation can happen, or at least parsed more efficiently than we are currently doing. Right now transactions are completely unordered but still must be parsed in the proper order of the "causal dag".  

Some of the options are likely things that the BCH devs are aware of.  Greg does know a lot, but seems to always need to appear to know more than everyone else.

Agree.

Frankly, i'm a little tired of all these bullshit fake arguments that its "confusing".  Every moron who's ever visited coinmarketcap knows that BCH and BTC are two different coins.  It's time to stop entertaining nonsense theories that are just a distraction from the real issues.
100% this.  I agree there shouldnt be a protocol change for SM.  Sadly, CSW is playing right into their hands.  He would have been 10x more effective arguing on simple game theory principles.  And worse, undermining his own credibility with the way he is publishing papers, drafts, whatever.  And apparently not giving 2 fucks what people think yet at the same time wants to be taken seriously.  
You're lucky if talking about 2MB doesn't get you banned.  100mb? forget it.

Everything is hard when you don't believe it or don't want it.  Scaling is hard.  Decentralization is hard.  Consensus is hard.  Deployment of hard forks is hard. Bitcoin being both a payment system and a store of value is hard.

This is a new low for you Eric.  Jeff isn't doing anything except writing code.  The miners are the ones will be "attacking themselves" (in reality, upgrading the network). You truly make me sick trying to attack Jeff like this.   
What do you think about proposals to have an algorithm based blocksize that keeps max size above demand?   The benefit would be to make the code more immutable and avoid controversy and intervention in the future.

its actually core blocking segwit.  2mb+segwit was offered multiple times.  They would rather NOT have segwit than increase the blocks.  How sad.
my favorite part: "If they stop distracting you from the actual and simple problem for just 1 second, you'll immediately find out they've been lying their asses off for years"
Delist attempt will go absolutely nowhere given the amount of industry support for BCH.  It's a lot higher than the "bcash trolls" would like everyone to believe.
> Cash shuffle is just a rebranded Coin join

First of all, this isn't true at all.  CashShuffle is a superset of CoinShuffle, which is a superset of CoinJoin.

You're not very intellectually honest to ignore this distinction on the one hand, and then on the other complain that Roger's argument isn't technically precise.  Lower fees DO mean better privacy in practice.  

In addition, BCH is getting Schnorr before BTC, enabling more privacy possibilities.

>Also have you guys heard of this thing called the lightning network

You mean that thing that barely works even for nerds, requires an always-on full node, and relies on heavily centralized "banking 2.0" hubs. Yep. We've heard of it.

>The market seems to prefer it as a scaling solution 30:1 right now 

Yep, pretty sad how effective the Blockstream/Core propaganda machine is and/or how ignorant the crypto masses are.  BTC is moving away from the p2p electronic cash system toward recreating the banking system via Lightning.  But the delusion won't last forever.


Here here.
This is exactly what Craig wants people to do.  Dump, so that the price goes down.  

It is clear that this entire game he is playing is malicious.  I'm hodling.
I care about what's best for BCH.  I'm absolutely sure that the community rejecting nChain's attempted power grab and intrusion into protocol decisions is best for BCH.
Wow.  When even blockstream is saying don't use BTC....I think it's the end for BTC.
Bitcoin is a social contract.  The public agreement of 21m coins trumps any code.  So I actually agree with Theymos in this case :\
some of these points i can agree with.  looking forward to talking more about it this week :)
>Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

They are enforced on whatever chain is willing to mine them, which is in turn supported by whatever market supports each group of miners.  That's quite different than some pre-defined social contract where people "obey" the outcome of a hash war.
you mean Bangkok.  No, it was not addressed.  If I had known about this, I would have raised that issue.
Not exactly.  Just to set the record straight:  1. the OP_DATASIGVERIFY is BU's proposal, not ABC.  2. I would personally rather see removal of topological ordering first before we go to full canonical ordering, or something like the "canonical compromise" video.

> A blockchain with unlimited blocks will sooner or later end up the same place.  To downplay this fact but at the same time criticizing LN for the same is the dishonesty.

This is a myth though.  There's no evidence that increasing the blocks will centralize bitcoin to any degree.  It may very well be that the costs associated with higher bandwidth will always be an insignificant portion of any serious mining operation.

lesser of two evils from their perspective.  Anything not BTC is threatening but LTC is less threatening than BCH

4 years imo. 2013 is when peter todd and gmax started promulgating their bitcoin-cant-scale philosophy, which by now, has gone full retard.
Bitcoin.org is basically saying this:

"We don't agree with contentious hard forks and the NY agreement.  The fact that we got Segwit out of the NY agreement is ok though, because that part is a soft fork."

> the world now waits to see if luke-jr raises his safe block size limit from 300 to 400kb... 

don't get your hopes up.  If anyone is still confused here, its simple: 1mb is ridiculously small, 300kb is so obviously trolling.  Luke doesn't believe his own nonsense; he's just paid to be an extremist.  He does a pretty good job at it.
a badly done scam.    In addition what are probably bad binaries, they want you to go to their "btc family trade" site (the only listed exchange) and deposit your bitcoins so they can steal them.
True it was ported from Core. According to JJ, Core inadvertently fixed it. Other implementations didn't have the vuln.  2 days to port , review, and test a large change is still impressive.  Btw, why didn't Core communicate the vuln to other groups if they knew about It?  
I'm a bit more optimistic than that, but probably many people hold similar opinions to yours.  I think people that take your position ("its annoying but not that bad") may be underestimating the severity of just how badly bitcoin has been crippled by the core developers and just how radical (in a bad way) their roadmap is.  
Segwit was simply sold on "HF are bad" narrative.... It was the new shiny object to get everyone excited about a SF way to increase capacity.
True, we don't the fact that Luke got goxxed to tell us that his 300kb block mentality is retarded.
The worst thing about supporting segwit is you're keeping the core devs in charge who want to change bitcoin into a settlement network.  Their plans are nothing short of diabolical.  But to address your post, its not Roger's job to come up with a million reasons miners would be incentivized against this.  He thought of one decent one.  He also pointed out that the attack may not be as big of an issue as some think because of propagation improvements.  Certainly:  this is no reason to keep the 1mb limit.  Generally, most people against the core scaling roadmap are not die-hard BU supporters, we just want bigger blocks and whether that comes in the form of BU, 8mb, whatever...its better than activating segwit and going with the core roadmap.  I'm always skeptical when people say they are neutral or used to be pro big-block and then start attacking Roger Ver, bringing up asicboost, etc.  
Yes it is very simple to understand...which is why it should also be simple to understand that Adam Back is being dishonest when he starts talking about BU president etc

depends what you mean by 'coming' and 'soon'...and swap with what.  We can already do atomic swaps with Mark Lundebergs' openswap tool.  But, like CashShuffle, it needs a critical mass of liquidity.  openswap could become a pretty good dex if a market maker comes in w liquidity.  

Then there are also bch to bch swaps which I hear will benefit from schnor.
So Roger is supposed to *apologize* for the market now?   He's responsible for the price?  You sound just like a paid troll and every bit as idiotic.  Please go away.  Find another community if you don't believe in Bitcoin Cash.

You're right.  ABC is the de facto reference (for now).  However, I don't agree with the conclusion that its "very troubling".  Its just where we are at currently.

> and make sure it's dealt with by November. 

You're looking at this the wrong way.  How do you propose we "deal" with it?  By somehow punishing ABC?  No, ABC has the most influence because its done the best job and shipped code the fastest.   

ABC developer Shammah Chancellor published the HF spec months ago.
https://github.com/schancel/spec/blob/1f10134b3ed036db60c4814a1f750878674576fb/may-2018-hardfork.md

Other groups didn't get their code out before ABC, but so what?

There's some misconceptions about decentralized development that I'd like to clear up in the near future.


The fees are high on BTC because of the limited blockspace.  
They are sometimes low because everyone gave up on BTC.
 If the capacity is low, you can either have low fees or low usage.

You can't have low capacity, low fees, and high usage! 
But with BCH, you can have high capacity, low fees, and usage.  Get it?
 
Hell yeah!  
Of course.  It's just another day in the office for the Dragon's Den.

It was great work on deadalniz to port the change as I said. Sipa is a good engineer skill wise but works on terrible things like segwit and part of the corrupt core which arguably acted in a malicious manner by not telling other devs in the crypto community about the vulnerability including other bitcoin implementations in the hopes they could weaponize it.  
Funny thing is, most fans of Litecoin, Ethereum, Dash, Monero, Pivx, Dogecoin, Bitshares, etc.... don't come here and talk shit.  It only seems to be the fans of Bitcoin core that are arguing stupid positions that don't make any sense.

this should be reported to the police.  It is a serious crime and shouldn't tolerated.
> I believe that if blocksize were not limited Bitcoin would become centralized and fail
 
Obvious false dichotomy of either huge blocks or 1mb forever.  In reality, we should have responsibly increased 2 years ago to 8mb. 


I dunno... personally I think adults should be allowed to sell what they want as long as they aren't doing it fraudulently.  I do not need or want the SEC to protect me, babysit me, or tell me what's good or not.
be very careful what you agree to, Roger.  A lot of people are counting on you to support their interests.  There musn't be any room for trickery, and we all know there is a very insidious faction to which honesty means nothing.
dear miners, I want bigger big blocks.  do it now. JF.
what benefit would it be for him to lie about this?  Anyway, you don't have to "prove he's a liar".  Greg's actions speak for themselves.  Mempool is 100k+, fees are in the dollars, marketshare nearly down to 50%, and he is doing nothing about it.  Actually, this is exactly what he wanted.  Well, he could say "i didn't want marketshare to go down" but then it would be evidence of economic idiocy.  Greg's not an idiot, he just wants to change Bitcoin into a settlement network and profit from it (probably at the expense of everyone else).

>the obfuscation depends on other users using cashshuffle. your privacy set is only as big as the number of users implementing the 'protocol'

...Which is why we're implementing it in major wallets like Electron Cash and Bitcoin.com.... not some obscure wallet like "wasabi".

>using cash shuffle may actually increase your legal liability depending on source of funds from other users. once funds are 'shuffled' your tainted set actually increases.

Sharing/spreading the "taint" with everyone is the whole point.

>does nothing to improve privacy for recipients of BCH.

It provides a specific type of privacy.  Obviously its not going to magically shuffle coins to a new address before it can shuffle them.

>does nothing to prevent tracing analysis,. just makes it more difficult.

Making it more difficult, that's the point.

>does nothing to prevent backwards tracing of funds to wallets

It's not retroactive, that's true.

>does nothing to prevent analysis of wallet balances

Right, it doesn't solve every problem.  It's a specific type of privacy tool.

>does nothing to prevent heuristic analysis and timing attacks.

Maybe you can explain how a timing attack would work here.  Since coins are preshuffled, i'm not sure that matters anymore.

P.S. like someone else said, its not supposed to be Monero, its not pretending to be Monero, no one is claiming its as private as Monero.  It's a practical application of CoinJoin for Bitcoin Cash.  
The safety of SPV has been proven empirically via the simple fact that there's no known cases of users losing funds because of an SPV-based attack.

No, they correctly stated that it doesnt stop two incompatible rule sets from splitting the chain. 
1. This is a lie.  No dev group in BCH wants to "keep the blocks small".

2. Putting a number out there of how big you want the blocks is not a roadmap.  Some of the people saying these things have no clear plan of how we get there or even what the bottlenecks are.

3. Here is an example of an actual roadmap to allow BCH to scale:

Thank you for pointing this out. Anti troll measure. 
I helped Amaury with the first website when it came out because guess what... ABC are the ones who created Bitcoin Cash.  ABC was the first client; it was all we had.  I very much support multiple implementations.  Currently I do not work for ABC, code for ABC, or get paid by ABC.  That is going to be my only reply in this thread to your insanity.
The idea of bigger blocks and a few op codes shouldn't be controversial.  The main thing the community has a problem with is not the idea of the proposal per se but rather:

1. the team behind the proposal and their actions.  To be specific, this is a team that raised objections publicly and created contention right before the three-month cut off date...to say nothing of their other behaviors.

2. The proposal lacks substance.  "128 mb blocks" is not as simple as changing a variable.  It says nothing about how this level of scale will be achieved.

3. The software client is non existent.  It is unrealistic to depend on a new implementation without sufficient testing from a team with little experience in the arena.



Interesting take... without taking sides here, I think people should be consistent.  Some people are saying that 32mb are nowhere near big enough to support certain businesses that want to use BCH.  That may be so, but then those same people shouldn't argue against optimizations that would help us handle huge blocks.  Just saying.


>"there is nothing that could be conceivably desired that cannot be done within bitcoin"

Depends what is meant by "within bitcoin".  There are many things you cannot do directly.

For example, if you want to create a script that does a trustless wager based on the block hash of the previous block, there is no op code for that, or other similar ways of introducing randomness that don't rely on shared secrets which can be cumbersome beyond the most basic constructions (i.e. ChainBet).

If you want to make an agreement with 10 people that they will all get an equal share of revenue from, say, a donation address, there is no way to do that because you cannot create transactions ahead of time without knowing the amounts and utxo.  

Some things can be worked around satisfactorily; others cannot.

Nope. bch is peer to peer electronic cash.  Btc stole the brand. 
Bitcoin Cash is the bitcoin I signed up for.  Peer to peer electronic cash without any silly capacity restrictions, and meant to grow as Satoshi envisioned from the start.  Segwit and Lightning Network is some weird alternative that somehow was allowed to hijack the BTC ticker and Bitcoin name.  
i think bch is accepted more places than doge coin.  but if doge is your favorite coin, that's cool.  
I agree.  By 'Bitcoin', I mean BCH. SegwitCore coin doesn't interest me anymore.
The one metric they cannot get around is TPS capacity... oh wait, yes they can...they can say there's not demand to do more than 3 tps.  Guess you really can't fix stupid.

>But it can never be bitcoin. If the only way you can succeed if you can fool everyone to belive you are bitcoin, the entire basis for BCH is a fraud.

Bitcoin Core was either lying or misinformed for years about this issue and I'll be damned if we're just going to let them flip flop their entire position which has been 100% wrong.

2x was your chance, Core, and you rejected it.  Good luck convincing the miners and coordinating an upgrade without splitting the chain.  I will use every resource I can to be a [No-2x] guy.

All this said, its important for BCH to put the pedal to the metal in 2018 and put as much space between us and the competition as possible in terms of merchant adoption and ecosystem development.

>Can you blame a commercial entity for trying to take over it? They are not evil and not malicious, they identified a weakness and are following a well devised plan to gain control over something of value using all means possible. This is capitalism 101. 

That is a plausible argument, however you could say the same thing about Monsanto trying to take over the world's food supply.  The morral objections to Blockstream consist (at least) of:   1. rampant deceit/dishonesty   2. abuse and subversion of an open source project. 3.  low level of intent toward the users and humanity. 

Just because a corporation isn't breaking laws doesn't mean it has integrity, or goodwill.  It doesn't mean it's creating value.  It doesn't preclude it from being destructive and malicious.
another case of the small dogs barking the loudest.

ive been saying this more or less to people that believe Bitcoin can be gold 2.0 without utility (fast cheap payemnts).  Gold can be gold because its been used for thousands of years.  It's also a physical commodity.  Cryptohashes are tulip bulbs unless they do something useful.  
good luck with your little mind control project
The median is low on BCH because there are a large number of small transactions (most probably SLP token transfers).  But there are also a lot of large transactions on BCH which is why the **average (mean) TX value is higher on BCH than on LTC**, even the median value is lower.
brilliant argument. I'm convinced.
Let the idiocracy of small blocks continue on r/bitcoin and BTC while we keep building Bitcoin Cash.  

The argument that small blocks prevent spam is retarded.  Big blocks allow room for all transactions without making the fees go high.  Even if you spam a big block network to the point where blocks are full, it still becomes expensive again but at a much higher throughput.  Moreover, if the BTC network is say 80% or 90% full naturally then spamming only requires that extra 10% of transactions paying high fees.  Notice they are calling veriblock and coinbase "spam" lol. 
> I think that in the future people will be able to buy Bitcoins (BTC) directly on the LN network

Hello "Rogver" (fake Roger Ver impersonator).

You mean IOUs for BTC.  You don't actually own a bitcoin until its recorded on the blockchain.  And so it begins, just like paper promises of gold, you're talking about a smart contract promise for a bitcoin.  It may start off fully backed (if you can pay the onchain fee to claim it).  Later it will be "submarined swapped" or something else to give people not even a guaranteed bitcoin, only a token within the LN.

It was supposedly Craig himself not nchain in this case and afaik he hasn't paid anyone. Based on a conversation with Jimmy it was never a good idea so I think Craig ws never serious. It's fine if he doesn't pay. The point is he there is a track record of broken promises. Let's see if he pays awemany.
Is there an outline or agenda? Sounds interesting
>To what degree did you see that point of view represented at the meeting?

Not much.  Jerry from SBI bits and maybe 1-2 others.
please post on r/bitcoin.
Re: GROUP... For the record, I have been neutral to somewhat supportive of GROUP.  I do not think it is as bad as some people do, but on the other hand I appreciate the scrutiny and the high bar that the protocol developers put on changing the protocol.  In either case, it is not my decision to make.
I'm pointing out the fact that despite them literally saying "lighting banks", the BTC crowd STILL doesn't object to the direction.  Really says something about where they are at.  Also, no recognition of our correct predictions... just goalpost moving.
Oh I beg to differ.   I don't believe for a second that Peter Todd was being ingenuous when he said "Oh look its O(n).  Can't scale, sorry guys! ".  Nor I do believe Greg Maxwell was, when he said "There were nodes before miners" or (in 2017): " fees are 1/2 sat per byte most weekends".  Nor I do believe believe Luke Jr. was when he recommended 300kb blocks.  

People like Greg Maxwell, Pieter Wuille and Andrew Poelstra are far from stupid (at least in the traditional sense).  So then, if they're not stupid, you must find another explanation for their words and deeds.

Just one of many contradictions in their ideology.   It would make sense that it's internally inconsistent if its driven by ulterior motives.
Lightning network is not permissionless, therefore not censorship resistant.  There is a difference between a large hub and a large mining pool.  Either can refuse you service, but in the case of a mining pool, another pool would just pick up your transaction for inclusion into a block.  In the case of hubs, the same is not true -- you can only be serviced by the hubs you have a channel with, and since your money can't be in more than one place at a time, your money will be divided up to the extent you have channels open with multiple hubs.
Lightning Network's hashed time lock contracts are clever.    Trying to move everything off chain is not.

BCH is innovating the protocol in ways that do not hinder it from being peer to peer electronic cash, like Graphene, UTXO commitments, cannonical transaction ordering, etc.

If there is no physical danger, it would make his actions that much more spineless.  I assume there are some risks and I understand, if not approve of his actions.
also it rewards saving from people's hard work, saves people from the ravages of inflation, and stops the rich from getting richer while living off the back of society.
Its great.  With applications like memo coming online, the 32mb blocks will ensure we don't hit a bottleneck in the next 6 months, although hopefully we'll come close! :)

By the way, its not just ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) has already released a fork ready client.
Daniel K is a big blocker.  He presented at SV conference
The new talking point of the week.  Good one.  I think doge does many micro tx but overall monetary volume is much more on BCH than either doge or ltc
No they just said you could withdrawal but not buy. Correct me if I'm wrong.
Knots has been around forever though
temporarily boosting profitability comes at the expense of extra short term inflation and degrading the issuance schedule.  There's no free lunch.
This is completely normal market behavior.  Fundamental announcement (no2x) creates huge spike (repricing) which usually goes too far at first due to momentum.  Then the market corrects...and the trend continues.  We'll see more increases in BCH/BTC ratio in the weeks to follow.  Its clear its a new bull trend for this pair.  Unless Core fixes scaling, I don't see a reason that would change.
Was 300 not long ago
Ok maybe they could have been more inclusive.  My understanding was that you created your own EDA proposal, but it was not one of the ones being considered by the other devs.  I also was told that you banned Amaury from your slack.  I am not completely shocked he didn't invite you to further discussions.  

I think we all agree the process sucked and we need a much better
one for the future.  

the current EDA is not great at stabilization, it is good at stealing hashpower.  but that is not a long term strategy.  
It's fine if btc appreciates. I have some as an investment.  But its moving away from peer to peer electronic cash.  
thx to kyuupichan and others.  if its being used for 235k BCC, it should be good enough for most people.  except luke jr of course
>DJBunnies doesn't have anything to do with Blockstream..

He is an admitted member of the dragon's den.  I guess the dragons den has nothing to do with blockstream.  They just happen to agree by coincidence.  :/
This doesn't make sense to me.  Maybe i'm missing something.  A business can simply run a 1x node and see exactly what got confirmed on 1x.  I don't see how the 1x chain will get "corrupted"
u gave it cheese? too generous.
decentralization risks are greatest when you force users off the main chain because it is turned into a settlement layer.  That is EXACTLY what Core is doing.  Node cost increases have been greatly exagerrated, and there's been misinformation about SPV... but hey we can agree to disagree.

But, what good is coinjoin if tx fees makes people not even want to bother with it?   Let's see in 1-2 years which chain is actually using coinjoin the most.
im not complaining at all now that there is bitcoin cash.  may the best coin win.  may we all profit.
The commments to this post are so telling.. PATHETIC attempts to divert the conversation to r/btc or reddit, and cannot look reality in the eye.  I wonder why they are so scared of Satoshi Nakamoto.  

Lets see...geez... I have no idea...oh wait... could it be that Satoshi's white paper is titled PEER TO PEER ELECTRONIC CASH?

This is the most terrifying idea in the world to some people.

Answers part 1.  If you feel I didn't answer you or want more clarification, post again:

On Splitting of coins:

Once a forking block occurs, there will be a chain split. The forking block is required to be greater than 1mb, so the chain split will be easily detectable.  Make sure you wait for the announcement and verify using a block explorer.

Your private keys will work on both chains.  Your seed phrase will work on both.  I agree that for maximum safety, moving coins to new addresses is not a bad idea.

Electrum Cash implements the new Sighash type so if you send using Electrum Cash it should not be sending bitcoins on the legacy chain. Same thing the other way -- legacy bitcoin will not work on Bitcoin cash.

I suggest you send a tiny amount to test this out in both directions.

On multisig:  

Multisig IN GENERAL doesn't change in BCC except for the fact that new sighash type is used.  I believe ABC supports multisignature transactions but they will all use the new sighash but maybe the ABC developers can clarify.  I have to see if non hardware multisigs will be supported on Electrum Cash.  Let's let Kyuupichan verify this.

On hardware:

In order to make hardware compatible, we need firmware updates that support the new sighash type but will implement as soon as we are able. Unfortunately that won't be available Aug 1.

On ElectrumX:

See this: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6pnv29/i_will_be_maintaining_the_electrum_cash_wallet_ama/dkqycy9/

On Bug Bounties:

Haven't thought about it, but sure!  Bring a serious bug up and we'll pay you.  Bring a minor bug up and ...we'll see :)

On Wallet Files:

You should be able to copy wallet files if you desire

On the Electrum trademark issue:

The Electrum team are great people, and regardless of the legal technicalities, my intention is to cooperate with them.

I was asked very nicely to modify the first version of the logo which used the electron image and was quite similar to Electrum's logo.  I have done that.  

The new logo does not use the electron logo, has a large Bitcoin Cash flag and a large "Cash" text.  It is now quite different and distinguishable.

I will continue to solicit feedback from and cooperate with the Electrum team.    If they think further changes to our website or logo are necessary, I will do my best to reasonably comply with their wishes.

I understand their position that they do not want people to be confused between the projects or for anyone to think the same development team is developing Electrum Cash.  I will make that as clear as possible on the website.
 
I also understand their position that Bitcoin Cash may not just be "an altcoin" (I agree!) and that they should have the right to be the only "Electrum" for Bitcoin Cash.  I agree with this also.  If and when they decide to support and implement Bitcoin Cash, I will be more than happy to sunset the project and let them run things.  

Ordinary users dont give a fat fiddler's fuck about any of this shit, you pea-brain.  All they want is low fees and fast confirmations.
Finally.  No more trying to convince the morons that low fees and fast confirmations are what the market wants.  Let the market speak.
There's some truth to what your'e saying but all is not lost.  What you're seeing are the exact reasons that the "scaling debate" ends August 1st.  We are moving on with Big blocks.  Let the banks do what they want.  Let BlockstreamCore do what it wants.  I just won't be running any of their code.  I'll be using the fork that is the peer to peer electronic cash that I signed up for when I got into Bitcoin.

  
That is more true at greater network sizes and less true at smaller ones like now. Currently, there is no technical problem with much larger blocks.  Only political ones.  
if you read the plan, they say:

>Market sentiment for a big block hard fork is strong, and economic rationale drives us to mine it, for example, the exchange rate is in favor of big-block Bitcoin;

as a condition to continue mining.  I believe they believe this sentiment is already in place.  
segwit is to a simple blocksize increase what completely rebuilding a car is to an oil change
We need more people speaking the truth
> failed to pruduce coherent arguments as to why the blocksize need to be raised

Come on dude.  It's 2019.  How many people still believe this bullshit?
man its too bad Scatman fell for the BSV thing.  Talented dude with the memes and stuff.  Come back to the light man.  Bitcoin Cash is still Bitcoin Cash :)
The problem imo, is the inconsistency.  When Bitcoin Unlimited had more than 50% signaling and it was looking like there'd be a good chance of a big block majority chain, the BTC supporters denounced using the longest chain as the definition of Bitcoin.
what's he mean "clearer" audits? i thought tether's never had an audit.
cult of core obviously.  They aren't "bitcoiners" they are BTCers.
It's a valid opinion that BCH = Bitcoin.  It's a p2p electronic cash system.  Sure BTC is the most PoW but it has artificially small blocks that prevent it from being a good p2p cash system for the world.

No one owns the Bitcoin brand, and Bitcoin is an idea that isn't subject to authoritarian edicts.  The ticker symbol doesn't define Bitcoin.   
lol ok bud.
i'm loving the low prices because I get a ton more coins if I get paid.  keep accumulating boys.  The value is in the currency, in its qualities and usefulness..and in the community...and the network effect of people using it...and even in the human spirit of those pushing it and the idea forward.  Bitcoin Cash is the people's money.  Keep your dollars.  I want Bitcoin Cash.
>No one wants to buy BCH. It is absolutely fucked. 

The fundamentals of BCH are still strong (community, adoption, development, apps).  If people want to sell, they can.  Smart investors will keep accumulating at a discount.
>CSW claims in the article that Bob would stop mining on his own block once he saw Alice's block. How are you not sure this is a load of garbage?

First, whether Bob would "stop mining" wasn't the question being discussed.  It was about the probability of a block being "discovered" at the same time, not whether the block was accepted, propagated, etc.  

Second, mining is an essentially memory-less process.  Meaning that if Bob stops mining because Alice found a block, he starts trying to find the next block.  He is just as likely to succeed at given moment on this next block as he would have been had he continued to mine the previous block.  So it doesn't matter whether he starts a new block or not.

Third, this isn't the default client behavior anyway.  Miners typically validate the block before mining on it.  But even if they didn't, it wouldn't really change anything about the question of how likely it is that a block is found within 20 seconds.
No need to say ABC. It is just Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
There's really no need to allow reorg more than 5 or 6 blocks anyway. If there is one it's a bug and the miners can just invalidate or reconsider block. We don't want to allow huge reorg.
Username checks out
permissioned mining is not bitcoin.  If you support SV , be aware of what you are supporting.  
Permissionless p2p cash is the goal.  Ask yourself which chain best supports that.  Until now its been BCH... After the dust settles, re-evaluate.
In arnhem didnt Craig say something like "not because I say something is the best, but because the market does".  Doesnt exactly align with attacking other chains. 
Please read section 10 of the bitcoin whitepaper.  The privacy model for Bitcoin is brilliantly illustrated.  There is already a barrier between identities and transactions which is naturally supported by the ability to move funds from one address to another and to use multiple inputs and outputs.  CashShuffle merely adds further support to this barrier and does so without changing the Bitcoin protocol.  

love this explanation!
>ABC roadmap says more OP codes are planned

The "more op codes" you see on the ABC roadmap refers to those that nChain wants.
That's why they spent $50M on permissionless ventures to grow the ecosystem.
1. SegWit is an optional transaction type; they do not have to use it.  I don't think its possible to block scaling on BTC in an absolute way.

2. The new narrative should be seen as a win; they are seriously backpedaling from "BCH is a fraud/scam"... now its "well maybe its works but... then BTC will do it too".

3. Trust is a big thing... BCH is about big blocks from day 1.  BTC has a multi year history of lies.  Even if they raise the blocksize to 2mb, are you really going to trust them?  Many won't.  

4. We should keep building adoption and ignore BTC.  Stop attacking them.  Let them be the boiling frog.  By the time they realize that BCH has massive adoption and try to raise the blocksize they will have lost their network effect and it will be too late.


> CSW maintains a Twitter feed without dissent by blocking anybody (especially devs) who disagrees with him. This means that his followers read his comments in an uncritical environment, and the lack of visible controversy lulls them into believing the claims to be uncontroversial, insightful, and true.

The same is true about his slack channel.  I was one of the devs who was blocked, not for anything I said on the slack, but for supporting bitcoin ABC on reddit.
This post doesn't really make sense to me. The ordering inside a block of not much to do with the time stamping function of the blockchain.
No, bcash is a is js implementation.  Bch is more commonly known as Bitcoin Cash.
The Sighash flags' hex values need to change, not just for the normal transactions which is what typically allowed BCH 2-way replay protection, but for all sighash types afaik.

There should be discussion of first generation EDA, chain death sprial, and updated DAA.


Bitcoin blocks have variance.  Since you're a beginner, maybe do a bit of reading:

https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin+for+beginners&oq=bitcoin+for+beginners&aqs=chrome.0.0l6.4063j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8



Who is rawpool? They went from1% to 9% 
hmm. objectively this is not a trend.  That would require lower highs and lower lows.  This chart shows lower highs but also higher lows , making it a triangle, setting up for a breakout in one direction or the other.
Came here to say that
sure you can, by not changing the block limit that was supposed to be temporary.
as long as it is not a substitute for main chain scaling (which is what Blockstream wants to do), then it doesnt change the security model
that would be freakin sweet.
Let core follow their roadmap. Real bitcoin is bch.
Bitcoin Cash is doing pretty well with a 43 billion dollar market cap and in 3rd place (let's ignore chuck-e-cheese premine token XRP) after only being around 5 months. 


BCH and ETH have market caps that seem reasonable.

BTC has an inflated marketcap based on the false assumption that second layers (LN) will be ready soon, usable, decentralized, and censorship resistant.  



Very informative . Great post dude.
boycott bitfinex
He doesn't owe anyone that proof.
we need to do this in every city
yes it is already merged so will be in next release as BCH ticker
I think this is great.  It seems people are saying "duh this is how it is supposed to be", but obviously it wasn't.  The key distinction is that miners AND developers need to agree to follow a process like this.

Aside from the actual utlitity, it caused a great amount of concern/risk/negative sentiment when bitcoin was appearing to not scale.  I think it is not a coincidence that fee spikes coincided with investors moving to other coins.  You could see it reflected in social media as well, as there were a lot of ethereum pumpers, dash pumpers, etc. even btc hodlers started diversifying to mitigate risk.

That said, I'm not sure why Roger cares any more.  Now that we have Bitcoin Cash.
I am doubtful Adam even owns 250 BTC
Old article and presenting Roger out of context.

Thanks for the civil discussion u/fullstep... I'll give a reply here as well as to u/Tulip-Stefan.

When I say that SegWit was never something that was desired and Core pulled out of their ass, here is my perspective:  This goes back WAY before the Hong Kong agreement.  In fact, it goes back to before I was even around in Bitcoin -- back to the early days in 2010, 2011.  The blocksize limit was always intended to be temporary.  I'm not going to debate that fact -- read my [Open Letter to Miners](https://keepingstock.net/an-open-letter-to-bitcoin-miners-c260467e1f0) if you want more of the history.  I got into Bitcoin in 2013.  As far as I could see, at that time, everyone had assumed Bitcoin would be allowed to keep raising its Blocksize.  It was that year that Greg Maxwell and Peter Todd started a thought campaign that Bitcoin can't scale, or can't scale efficiently, or can't scale and stay decentralized, etc.  Gavin had tested 20MB blocks, which got pushback, so it went to 8MB, 4MB, 2MB, etc... Basically Core fought blocksize increases tooth and nail and actually stalled any progress whatsoever while making it appear that all that needed to be decided was exactly how big an increase would be permissible.  You can argue that this never happened but IMO it certainly did. I recall Gavin saying "Ok fine we can do 2MB if that is the consenus"...which never happened... You had this huge rhetoric (largely coming from Greg, Luk, etc) that we can't do anything without consensus.  Mike Hearn wrote about this when he quit.  You had all this stalling and nonense for, what, 2 years?  And then some "conferences" and then all of a sudden from nowhere Pieter announces SegWit, which is suddenly great because its not a hard fork?  Really??  That is what I mean when it say it was never desired, Core pulled it out of their ass.  Hope I cleared up why I said that.
 
>All meetings and decisions are made in the open, documented and published. Decisions are made based on the combined technical feedback from all participants, as well as a general sentiment from the bitcoin community (understanding that measuring the feedback of the community isn't an exact science). 

What you are saying could work in theory, but this is not actually what happens.  The discussion is dominated and directed by thought leaders (the most experienced devs) that basically have a monoculture of a certain way they want to develop Bitcoin; namely Greg's 2-layer approach.  If you go against that, you won't be heard.  Do you really disagree?  And the general sentiment of the community (which is already influenced by trolling and censorhip) is ignored in developer meetings.

>As far as decentralized development goes, it is about as good and fair as we can reasonably expect.

Well, in Bitcoin Cash development, thats not how it works.  There's multiple indepedent teams which is far more decentralized.  Anyone can innovate and if the ideas are good, they will be adopted.  Ther's not this one entrenched reference client and group.

to: u/Tulip-Stefan.

>segwit was never desired and something that core pulled out of their ass, but the entire market is running it, and all miners have voluntarly upgraded to it, and many exchanges are currently supporting it.

Segwit didn't even get 50% voting on its own.  It got to 95% because of the NYA.  Even people who disliked SW, like Roger Ver and Jihan agreed to NYA to move Bitcoin forward and were willing to compromise, unlike some people.  And again, this was all after the long history that I menionted above.

>What? Were litcoin users forced into segwit as well?

SegWit is overhyped and "solves" a bunch of problems that didn't even need solving (malleability) in the worst way possible -- how can you solve a problem when 95% of users aren't even using it.  I hate to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but SegWit is just based on propaganda.  It is of very little value IMO and does more harm than good.  The main "value" of SegWit is to Core, to a) give the appearence of a satisfactory capacity increase, and b) help them develop their second layer systems.


many have already seen my article breaking down why it doesn't work without hubs https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800
This, ladies and gentlemen,from the guy who called himself a "Bitcoin Maximalist".  
I see what you did there.  Why am I not surprised that this thread shows more of the toxicity of Greg and Peter, the thought leaders of the "Bitcoin can't scale on chain" movement, which has caused investors tens of billions of dollars.
Great work porting the fix to patch the vulnerability.
at least he didnt try to change Bitcoin into a settlement network though...amiright
unlike r/bitcoin, no one gets booted here.  Just downvoted for saying stupid shit.
FYI, i am not on twitter.  I am pretty sure its someone friendly running this twitter account but it is not me.
no, I mean a hub.  A financial entitty that opens channels with many people.
I personally dont need donations but tip the servers would be nice :)
heck, i dont even care if Greg wants to say he invented Bitcoin Cash...lol... just let on chain scaling happen :)
serious rebuttal from Greg? HAHAHAHAHA... that's too much.  The guy has done nothing but non stop troll, to the point of telling obvious, ridiculous lies:

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6cmtff/2_more_blatant_lies_from_blockstream_cto_greg/

What makes you think he's going to suddenly get serious and give you an honest answer about anything?
so he's heading to r/bitcoin?
He is hiding it (although its in plain sight).

I would feel very uncomfortable as well.  That's a bad deal.
Gmax in 2020:  "I didn't look to see how a fee market would work, because I had already proven it to be a great idea."
Pieter is a smart dude.  So, what problem does this solve?  
Anyone paying attention knows Blockstream/Core are obstructionists because its taking years longer than it should be to scale.  If you've ever watched a video of someone trolling and pranking someone and just wasting their time, eventually it becomes obvious they are trolling and pranking and just wasting time.   Blockstream/Core is just wasting everyone's time.... first by pretending to try to get consensus, then with fake conferences, then with broken agreements, then with "95% requirements for SF"...then with UASF... then with whatever else.... their obvious goal is as little on chain scaling as possible...their actions speak louder than any counter argument you can make... you can shill for them, make excuses, say that anyone who doesn't accept segwit is the one to blame... I don't care.. i don't believe it...   The fact that they rejected 2mb+SWHF perhaps speaks louder than anything else about their true intentions.  It's Core's job if they want to be leaders, to effectively lead us to scale, and they're not.  They're doing a fine job of appearing like they want to lead while actually obstructing... Time to wake up.   No other coin has a scaling problem... Wake up wake up... the problem is Core... it has been this whole time.  

Core devs do not give a shit.  They feel no urgency whatsoever to fix Bitcoin.  I don't care what they say, their actions prove this beyond a shadow of a doubt.  It pisses me right off.  
I agree, its irrelevant.  Well, except for the fact that obstructionists are using thinly veiled guilt-by-association tactics.
let them try it.. it will just cause them to fork off into a minority chain.
huh? Did you not offer 1 bch for a link showing a reference to bitcoin "before 2x failed"  Did I not provide that link?
He may have started supporting Bitcoin Cash before 2x failed completely, thanks for the correction.  

Roger tried his best to support a unified version of Bitcoin (2x) and wasn't one of the original founders who was there from day 1 like Amaury and Haipo.
That would make a great T shirt
Forget hodlnaut... what about the litigation aimed at open source software developers (in this case ABC). THAT is a much better reason to support the #DelistBSV idea.

Also, CZ, Bitcoin Cash community isn't bad. We just want p2p electronic cash as mentioned in the Bitcoin whitepaper. Please change our ticker to BCH.
you think that's bad.  Last I checked, cryptopia called it bcash and had a blank grey circle as a logo.
You're not wrong.

However, we're apparently living in some kind of idiocracy where the average person isn't smart enough to understand this.  Only feeling the pain of high fees directly can wake them from their stupor.
It's unlikely there will be consensus any time soon, if ever, to add more transaction capacity to BTC.  That ship sailed.  Scaling happens on BCH now.
It's a fair question. CS doesn't stop people from running a malicious server and trying to analyze what shuffles are being done in real time.  

My philosophy is that privacy is a sliding scale.  You have to decide how much of it you really need.  For me, I'll just connect to a pretty well known server that's been around for a while that I'm fairly sure isn't big brother.
For others, they might be a bit more paranoid and decide to run their own full node.
if you imported money over with the seed and you see it then its the right derivation path.  Probably what is happening is shuffles are going to change addresses in EC but not picked up correctly in bitcoin.com wallet for some reason.  Sounds like a bitcoin.com wallet issue.
https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/charlie-lee-is-wrong-lightning-is-not-more-p2p-than-bitcoin-8c35abe69d93
To me, it is the best.  BTC is non-viable because of the blocksize limit.. The only other contender would be BSV, which is more much centralized and has a questionable community.
when did I ever "take the credit"?  90% of the code is forked from Electrum.  
Most of those were opportunistic scams though, IMO.  Bitcoin Cash was the most legitimiate fork by far because it came out the 4 year long scaling debate. 
>Seems insane.

Bitconnect was selling for $400 and BTC which couldn't do more than 3 tps was $20k.  ...so, yeah.  The market is insane.
Agree.

It's intellectually dishonest for people to ask a black/white question "do you support 128mb blocks now" and insinuate that if you dont unequivocally and immediately say "yes" that you're against scaling.

I also hope we can get to gigabyte and beyond blocks. But lets do it with actual engineering changes that make it practical. 
>  It just locks your funds to one chain whether that chain wins or not.

How do you figure?  When you split your coins, you have them on both chains.


its a signal to the market.  Craig is playing chicken.  he'll only win if everyone panics.  But we wont :)
finally, a comment actually addressing the OP!  (the only one so far)

It's important to differentiate between majority of hashpower and difference of market power.  If the coin that has the most market value is being attacked with more hash power, its because the attacker is an irrational economic actor (at least short term).  Otherwise, if the chain supported by the attacker was better, it wouldn't need to burn money to attack; it would just compete.
What I'm getting at, as you noted, is the backlash factor.  If the attacker believes the short term money burn is just a loss leader, and the market will join its chain after they kill the other chain, they may be gravely mistaken.
go for it.  I'll be using Bitcoin Cash.
/u/deadalnix No one wants this, needs this, or has asked for this, afaik.  Why are you doing this?  
was it fun? :-)

Great job.  I love that BCH is getting more implementations.
> If a node isn't being used for economic activity, it isn't really all that useful. "Bob's long forgotten Raspberry Pi node" refers to that even Bob has forgotten about the node as he doesn't use it for economic activity. 

Yes but that is totally not the narrative they've been pushing for years.  It's always been about Bob's pi and how people like Bob are keeping the network decentralized.  That's the whole reason to keep blocks small, so the Bobs of the world can keep up.  The actual economic nodes can be damned if they want bigger blocks.  What about Bob?
i would be more surprised if he was actually guilty vs this being a deep state operation.  Call me a conspiracy theorist; it seems pretty fishy that these allegations are coming out right after he makes a stand on the right to sell information pertaining to guns.
Coingeek/nchain will attempt to gain economic majority, will be unsuccessful, and will then capitulate. Just my guess.
u/tippr $1
650? wha wha whattttt??
This is not correct.

A transaction (with one input and two outputs) is about 220 bytes.  At 1 sat/byte that would make it about a third of a penny.

While its true many wallets have bad fee calculators, you have overstated it.




i just see bch as the future and bitcoin at this point.  i cant see why anyone would build anything on btc.  being linked from this subreddit, i honestly had to check why it wasnt clear it was bch and then surprised it was btc. 
"Avalanche" is just another DAG based system.  These systems are ultimately just another form of Proof of Stake.  yawn.
Because it didn't have majority hashpower and exchnages didnt recognize it as bitcoin. We had to call it something.  If we just stuck our heads in the sand and said "nuh uh its bitcoin" i dont think that would have been productive at all.

nChain has already taken action with the Gigablock testnet.  Likely will be a lot more actions to come.

The original EDA was extreme and still failed to produce a death spiral. Updating the DAA intended to bring stability.  The flippening , if it happens, will be because the coin is used more and valued more, not because of cheap shots and short term tactics.
Incorrect.  Both new formats (as well as the legacy format) are encodings of the pubkeyhash.  When transmitted the data is actually the same (serialized).  It is the wallet that decodes and encodes the address format.  Probably not considered a "protocol change"
its misguided to think any DAA would help price.  Hash follows price.
Low fee spam doesn't cause $10-$20 tx.  People are actually paying those high fees across the board.  Many of them to exit.
great! also cashcaria is upgraded, so this is good. just let me know what you decide soon. i will need to update the seed list.  

so we have at least 2 confirmed, hope to get more shortly

edit: we have 4-5 now with these plus some from github.  we're in good shape already :)
Semantics.  If "capacity increases" are not scaling, fine.  We'll just do capacity increases.
u/luke-jr how is this not a lie?  SegWit never got beyond 50% signaling at any point on its own?

EDIT: Oh, and by the way, if Luke is going to lie about this in such obvious fashion, I think people should take another look at the lies he's recently told about SPV:

https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/spv-as-implemented-today-is-exactly-as-described-in-the-bitcoin-whitepaper-2a65265afbec

Honestly if they were sneaky and cunning enough to take over Bitcoin by corrupting the developers, they are sneaky enough to set up controlled opposition in 1x with 2x as the real goal
You're the CTO of B.S. and the author of the core scaling roadmap. Also Pieter,  blue Matt, Jorge, Luke,  Mark, etc  but yeah no such thing as blockstream core
Maybe this is a dumb question, but why can't we just have a mallaebility fix with whatever benefits its supposed to have (easier confirmations etc) but that doesn't make it possible to discard transaction signatures?
good point, should we have github shut it down?
This is not my repo.

Calmly explains stupidity of the opposition's argument. 
Good post, its really outrageous. Greg calls 2mb+HF (with community conesnsus) "toxic and risky", but now gives this backhanded approval with  rhetoric of "well, i dont support this particular proposal but uasf in general are great!"   hey Luke, are you guys lying now?  Or you were just lying for years?  Or both?  Greg and Luke playing good cop bad cop and playing chicken with the miners.  What a shit show. lol... My coins are in cold, why would i used them anyway with a huge mempool... popcorn is ready... 
or Greg will say 'some dipshits promised something they couldn't deliver on'.  I never approved this.
Simple. Bitcoin will become increasingly uncompetitive if it can't scale.
> Good miners who are already signalling segwit have nothing to worry about.

facepalm
dash is 45% proof of stake (call it proof of service etc , all the same thing).  That means people get rewarded for nothing.  This centralizes the wealth.  BCH is more fair because of PoW.
>Are there any plans to make Electron Cash a multi-coin wallet?

No.
totally non biased article /s
No need for Bitcoin Cash miners to waste millions now that the war is over.  We only need enough hash to keep the chain secure.
This is easy to work around and doesnt prevent reorg attacks. 

But I do have a solution to 51%. A few actually.  That's all I'll say for right now.
>circle jerking

Calling out bad behavior is a good thing. Especially on someone who controls lots of hash and is attacking everyone else in the community. 
>The fact that you had to say "not to villianize" the man to justify your comment is strong evidence that you are butthurt over something and are villanizing him

No.  Craig is a human being like the rest of us, and doesn't need to be "personally" attacked.  But his actions need to be called out.  That's my point here.  

>Anybody can contribute hash rate to the network and they don't have to answer or be accountable to anybody.

That's true.  It's also goalpost moving which says "ok so he's a plagiarist, so what".

> This is a permissionless system where hash rate decides, not Proof of Social Media

Hash rate extends or rejects blocks on the chain it deems valid.  It doesn't necessarily decide anything for the market, as much as you would like it to.

>Craig Wright is Satoshi, and has been proven correct again and again, and this is why he is attacked.

I wonder why 'Satoshi' would feel the need to plagiarize others work.  Would be a very interesting theory if you can come up with one.


It's allowed to scale and be usable as p2p cash. That's the whole point of cryptocurrency! Btc froze the blocksize and is trying another approach w second layers. 
wow.. so cool.
Not sure how many people are aware , but all development groups including BU, XT, ABC, nChain, etc.. met in london in 2017 and there was an agreed upon protocol upgrade schedule (although currently there is some contention about what is the upgrade).  Also, the upgrade cannot be postponed as the default code would be inoperable past the fork date; so the upgrade is mandatory.  And as others have mentioned, there is no nchain (or other) implementation currently available.

Also it needs to publicized and communicated. Exchanges and businesses need to upgrade.  Hard fork upgrades not happen on their own. There is coordinated communication behind the scenes that most are unaware of.
Newsflash; this just in -- both nChain and ABC are terrible with people skills and communication.  Tragic because they both want global cash and the roadmaps are quite similar.  Let's see what we can do.
Muhammed Ali is joining BCH? :)
Kraken
Sounds like concern trolling to me
Most vol on many coins is all speculative. Real usage of all crypto is low 
This is great derek.  What about also forking satoshi labs where they also keep the coin types etc... they are partial to core
CSW is controversial but he's pretty consistent on avoiding tinkering with the protocol unless there's a clear benefit.
oh...so we're done attacking Craig Wright and its back to blaming Roger this week for BCH?  I didn't get the memo.  Hard to keep up.
I would put "Ask me about Bitcoin Cash"... it invites people to talk to the pretty girls, and then you can leverage the opportunity to educate people.
not really a new idea.  andreas antonopolous was talking about hiding bitcoins in pictures of cats years ago.  
 >Probably the most disturbing thing to me from many members of the bitcoin cash community, was the inability for people to distinguish the difference between a role model in their community acting inappropriately, to the validity of Bitcoin Cash as a currency. 

I'm gobsmacked by this comment.  If YOU understand the difference between one person (role model or not) vs the coin, why are you even bringing up Roger?  It's got nothing to do with Bitcoin Cash.  
 
>Roger making directly hypocrital statements regarding segwit/lightning

Where?

> Roger claiming to have sold >1000 BTC for BCH then saying he hasn't.

He clarified that.  He sold futures in once instance.  No i'm not going to find the link for you.

> Roger's correlation of calling bitcoin cash bcash like calling a minority a slur.

I agree with him.  Removing the 'bitcion' from Bitcoin Cash is an insult to everyone who was around in Bitcoin before Blockstream screwed it over.

because even though you might get a discount with segwit, its still going to be pretty high fees.  Segwit doesnt really increase capacity that much.
some multi millionaire who owns stock in another car company just sold a bunch of ford stock. its a capital flight attack!

> Fact: Craig's businesses were failing and he needed money in 2015 - yes, 'Satoshi' needed money!  Fact: Craig signed a deal with nTrust that bailed out his companies in exchange for his patents and him agreeing to be 'unmasked as Satoshi’. 

Rich people know things about wealth management and taxation that you apparently don't.

> Fact: Craig claimed to be “the main part of [Satoshi]”  Fact: Craig literally admitted lying about (fabricating) that blog post claiming he was involved in bitcoin in 2009.  

...and?

>Fact: Craig lived in Australia during the Satoshi period. The time zone means that, to be Satoshi,  Craig would have almost never posted between 3pm and midnight, local time. His peak posting times would have been between 2am and 9:30am. This is practically the opposite of what one would expect.

FWIW i've talked to him on Slack. He holds pretty weird hours.

> Fact: Craig lost a bet on a simple technical question related to bitcoin mining   Fact: Craig produced a ‘math' paper recently 

It appears Peter R had to set Craig straight on a few things.  Sometimes csw doesn't explain himself well.  I suspect the bet was lost due to poor communication.  I assume Peter is right about self mining until proven otherwise.  But i am glad both Peter and Craig are working together on the gigablocks project.

>Fact: Craig traded bitcoins on MtGox in 2013 and 2014 - [2]

So what

>You pay the on-chain fee to "subscribe" to a LN channel

...with a large hub, yes. Exactly.
People seem to have amnesia.  As soon as the fees get so ridiculously high that everyone stops using Bitcoin and starts using something else, the mempool clears, and the morons have no memory of any problems.  "This is fine".
LN will **never** work as a scaling solution without centralized hubs.

No, they aren't.  Go read the 'ants don't have blood' post.  The worst case scenario for antbleed isn't that dire.  But stagnation of Bitcoin can be.

Yeah it just so happened that Calvin knew about it and tweeted it before anyone else.  Just by happenstance.  
I'm ok with an **optional** transaction type that fixes malleability.   However, making SegWit style TX mandatory is NOT something I support.

I feel a Bitcoin transaction should have inputs that are based on the previous transaction, signatures included. (e.g. the so-called "chain of digital signatures".)   Modifying this structure is not only unpalatable, but it moves the overton window toward accepting more such changes and modifies the structure to put us a big step closer toward BTC style SegWit.  I think the long term political risks of such a change do not warrant any supposed benefits of "fixing" malleability, at least any benefits that I am aware of.  That includes [Bitclub style attacks](https://www.newsbtc.com/2017/03/11/bitclub-performs-successful-malleability-attack-bitcoin-network/).

Use cases that demand a long chain of unconfirmed transactions can use the optional transaction type.  **Don't mess with my type 1 transactions!**
Right.  u/CultofEnvy Take a look at section 4.2 and the diagram with the yellow and blue boxes.  Alice starts out with her output address A' and adds encryption using Bob and Charlie's encryption keys.  Then she passes that to Bob.  Bob decrypts it using his own key so he now has Alice's address but its encrypted with Charlie's key so he can't see what it is.  He then adds his own address and passes it to Charlie.  Charlie then can decrypt this to get Alice and Bob's address, but he doesn't know which belongs to Alice or Bob.  Alice doesn't know whether Bob's address is Bobs or Charlies...and Bob won't know the difference between Alice and Charlie since he never saw Alice's plaintext address previously and didn't see Charlie's address until Charlie announced it.  Hope that makes sense.

As far as zKP, there is nothing to prove.  All that's important is that each individual confirms their own output address is present in the TX being signed.
I guess some people take longer than others to figure out that LN actually sucks as a scaling solution , even moreso with small blocks.   It's almost as if it was deliberately done to cripple the chain or something.
This is not Bitcoin Cash.

It is referring to this:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCH_code

These are error correcting/checksum codes used in BECH32 address and CashAddr.

Thank you!  We will rebuild! :)
btw we will do a new release of Electron Cash today.. a bit last minute but there's good changes in there including one that makes it easier to navigate the split as there a bug related to network level concerning forks.


the attack prompted thinking really long on the problem :)  necessity is mother of invention.
This was an old article from the btc vs bch scaling debate. 

I'm not even sure the point the OP is trying to make here.
Bitcoin girl is world famous :)
no one who supports ABC is talking about attacking other chains.  
Raising the block size to 128mb without any actual changes to support that or increase efficiency doesn't make sense.  The only way Bitcoin cash won't be economically viable is if Calvin spends tens of millions to constantly attack but that will not make bsv valuable. If you really want a how did we get here explnatition maybe I should write an article explaining everything 
No, I reject **your** interpretation of the whitepaper which believes that a minority chain is obligated to obey your rules or that the market is obligated to act in a certain way.  

If you think hash alone defines bitcoin, then logically you should support BTC.  

Enemy of Bitcoin?  Hilarious given my track record of creating FOSS software and protocols and writing dozens of pro Bitcoin Cash articles.  And your contribution is?
 
Its "how you scale bitcoin and keep it decentralized".  Iow it's got electrolytes. It's what plants crave.
And if you absolutely insist on crypto, use litecoin.
i dont think those actually exist.  Perhaps Core trolls.
Even without anyone can spend outputs, there are potential problems with SegWit as implemented in BTC which stem from the fact that there's no cryptographic commitment of the signatures. BCH proposals such as MalFix and Flextrans fix this afaik, but I would still be against those kind of changes because I see a political attack vector there leading to a slippery slope.  Given all the social/political vulnerabilities we've seen, I think it would be too easy in the future to have some group (either overzealous or intentionally malicious) push some kind "block template upgrade" which then does away with the cryptographic commitment and puts us back to BTC style segwit.  I'd rather not set one foot on that path.  It's important to understand overton window dynamics and speak out loud and early against any such changes.  (An even more dangerous change we need to prevent is the "miner Id" stuff I've heard about)
UASF wasn't a bad idea because it was overinflating the value of users. Users have always been important in Bitcoin.  UASF was bad because it was based on the misguided small blocker school of thought and also because it conflated node count with the economic majority.
Not really.  ABC has repeatedly said the old opcodes are fine and are on the roadmap for May.
Craig agreed in London that this sighash was a good idea, nitwit.
I do not see the point of testing BTC.  It is a waste of money.  

1. We know that you cannot fit 20 people on a 10 seat bus.  
2. We've seen overloading in action.  Result is huge fees, as expected.
3. a million tx at $1 each is $1M.  


Good to see actual technical discussion instead of drama
Well done. This will make it easier for developers. :)
Yep. If they are smart they will keep quiet...but they aint
u/micropresident  This is why I rewrote the home page of bitcoincash.org.  Hopefully it gets merged soon :)


You're right it's not irony. It's hypocrisy.
yeah.. really interesting that they not only censor mention of memo and blockpress \(which I would expect of them\) but actually anywhere that allows open and free discussion.
You know what Craig didn't do? He didn't try to stop or slow down one of the greatest advancements in human history: peer to peer electronic cash.
Team core can't compete on merit. Resorts to social engineering attacks. What a shocker.

https://i.imgur.com/tTX6QMU.png
Great work!!!

I don't think people realize what this is, so let me explain.

Many are aware that if you have a bitcoin address, you can "sign a message" with your address, which proves the message was authorized by the person controlling the address.  For example, if I'm known to be associated with a certain address, I can sign a message "jonald was here 4/19/2018" and everyone can check to see it was actually me that signed this message.  This is known as a **public key signature system**.

However, what the OP has created is something entirely different, which is known as a **public key encryption system**.  In this scheme, anyone can send me an encrypted message that only I can read (without us ever having to exchange keys).  So if you know my address, you can use it to encrypt a message and only I can decrypt it using my private key.  The most famous public key encryption system is "PGP" (pretty good privacy).  

I never heard anyone talk about using Bitcoin in this way, so its awesome to see it created.  Again great work and congrats on this achievement!
he must be getting personal lessons in clownery from Shamson.
The Satoshi question is irrelevant IMO.

Craig could very well be Satoshi and still say stupid shit.
Let me investigate:)
From the article:

>I would argue that OP_GROUP does not change this. OP_GROUP is a NO_OP, or “no operation”. It doesn't affect the script. This is the controversial part, that an op-code is added, but it doesn't affect the validation part of it

This misses the point.  It not just: "doesn't affect the validation part of it", its that it is expecting miners to act on that "op code" OUTSIDE of the script.   

Not sure why some people find this hard to understand.

It is also that new consensus rules are being added, new burdens/responsibilities are being given to miners...This is not really "just another op code", it is a BIG, fundamental change. That was the point of my article.  

A lot of people seem to miss this or dismiss this and want to take action without thorough analysis.  Tokenization isn't the top goal for Bitcoin Cash, and  there is more than one way to do tokens besides OP_GROUP.

Yes. Those coins offer value.
>Their narrative isn't even consistent from season to season

So true.

2014 - Block increase? sure, at the right time, with consensus.

2015 - Stop fudding, blocks aren't even full

2016 - We got this great new thing called Segwit that'll solve everything!

2017 - Main use case is store of value, until we have layer 2.
Not to take away anything from Amaury but there were many people involved in BCH creation like Freetrader, ViaBTC, and others, some seem, some behind the scenes.
"Furthermore, the Litecoin community has a philosophical overlap with Bitcoin and is not committed to on-chain scaling. The Bitcoin Cash community, by contrast, is fully committed to on-chain scaling and intends to increase the block size as needed in order to ensure that fees remain low. This is a critical difference"
the stupidest part of the 'spam attack argument' is that large blocks are a better solution than small blocks to a real spam attack.
I don't see why not if its a cold wallet.  No one should be using a hot wallet for anything remotely close to that big an amount.
pretty big difference between "locked in" and "we've never broken 50% but I think its happening because of these cool hats"

LOL. Cheers.
>The UASF people would have gotten a Segwit chain anyway

That's a theory.  That's not "locked in".  Agree?
>How so? You're betting on the existence of one chain vs the other. If one chain no longer exists the value of your bet is 0

Did you read the article?  This part:

>When you bet on BT1 (small block Bitcoin), you will not lose your tokens if no hard fork happens. However, those betting on BT2 will see their tokens destroyed.

By making it lopsided, they give the 1x the APPEARANCE of more value, which is an obvious deception.
Most of the people following BS/Core are victims of propaganda and/or don't have enough technical awareness to understand what is going on.  There are some others that understand Blockstream is changing Bitcoin into a settlement layer, but still have the misguided notion that this is a good thing.
"leeching of the brand" may be his personal opinion on it, but my opinion is that Bitcoin core subverted, perverted, and usurped the brand by promoting their layer 2 roadmap instead of the original Satoshi roadmap, which Bitcoin Cash is trying to restore. This restoration is the reason it exists.

You are way too smart to say something that stupid.   So how does this all work here as far as good devs becoming corrupted/compromised?  Is it just a cult of personality?  Does Blockstream pay you off?  Are you threatened?  Whats the story?
Why are you worried about second layer implementations so early in the game?  Let's give on chain scaling a chance first,...that's the point.  Maybe when blocks are hundreds of megabytes we can start to talk about it... for now its a harmful distraction.
and all of the counterparties that are providing the intermediary hops as well.
Roger never said "Sell all your BTC for BCC".  Roger never said "I'm going to sell all my BTC for BCC".   
 
You sound like a troll when you talk about asicboost.    Just relax and HODL, Bitcoin Cash price will be up at some point.  When you invest based on fundamentals you have to be prepared to HODL.  If you want a quick profit, you need to time the market.  Please take responsibility and don't blame Roger.

Has their been a single blockchain that's around today hasn't had 100% up time?  Seriously?
Much of the community has been asking for bigger blocks for years, so in some sense it is a power play and a good opportunity for the users who believe in on chain scaling.  The confidence of Bitmain in big blocks will attract other miners.    It IS actually what they want to hear.
>But you choose how fast your transaction gets confirmed via the fees you pay. 

If you're a somewhat-experienced bitcoiner, yes.  If you're just a worker trying to move their money to your bank and you screw up with the fee, the worst case scenario just got a lot worse.
Anyone can run the code they want, but everyone must use the same consensus rules or they will fork off onto another chain.  The core (reference) implementation was the one nearly everyone ran for a long time and still has an "encumbant entrenchment" like a veteran politician.  It is hard for people (miners, users) to decide to change.  In their favor, the core team has done an excellent job producing a stable, quality product that has kept the network running with a minimum of problems... except for the one huge problem of capacity.  In order to change the consensus rules, 51%+ of the miners have to run a different code, which is what Bitcoin Unlimited is all about.  
a single issue that is by far more important to me than all other issues combined.
Personally I don't care if bitmain is shady or not. All I care about is the blocksize.   
Well there are some interesting items on the table. Still , p2p cash is exciting even when sober. :_)
Good point.  But yeah, its better than nothing for now, and better to make these tools available while continue to research.  The privacy layer on BCH will keep working better the more tools people have.
> Wouldn't a bad actor always force everyone else into the less private second stage without joining it himself?

Maybe.  

Although what's in it for the bad actor?  He'd have to maintain his operation for the miniscule disruption benefit of having people trust servers with linkages.  Those ok with that would do so.  Right now, almost everyone trusts ElectrumX servers with their whole wallet history.

This is just one privacy tool of many we will make available for Bitcoin Cash.
Ship has probably sailed on redesigning the desktop client.  Remember we inherited the code in 2017 from Electrum.  But actually, we did hire a designer for the iOS... and he did a great job which is why people love it :)
Great insights as always Peter!!

> Well, the BSV community seems to be very litigious

Understatement of the year
Thanks for this. The usage is low at present but the tech works and its only the beginning!
This is misleading. Credit cards usually charge a minimum fee like 20 to 30 cents in addition to the percentag 
>To do this right, the outputs should all be the same size. 

Half the outputs are of the same size.  Those are the ones considered shuffled.  The others (change address) can be mapped but then you shuffle those again, and so on. 
>therefore a timing attack could deduce that Alice sent coins into Cashshuffle (for amount X), and in the same block, Cashshuffle sent funds to Bob (for amount X). I assume you are seeking a one block turnover.

Huh?  It's not only the same block its the same transaction.  

>the cyhperpunks are turning in their grave - and deep down, good Sir, you know it.

I had a chuckle.  There's few people as passionate about peer to peer electronic cash as myself and others in the BCH community.  Spreading economic freedom by promoting the growth of p2p cash is our raison d'etre.

Definitely a good summary of the BTC philosophy.  It's precisely the vision that Bitcoin Cash fervently disagrees with.  
not interested in POS much less dPOS
> I have been saying here for months that selling someone "BCH" when it contains no Bitcoin Cash (due to CTOR) is an example of civil fraud

You've been spouting non stop bullshit for months? Yeah... we know.
>Many Lawsuits are being introduced to address all the fraud and dishonesty used to promote BCH and BCH supporting companies. 

There hasn't been fraud or dishonesty used to promote BCH though.  It is in fact those lawsuits that are fraud and dishonest. 

I will keep working to build permissionless p2p cash regardless of how many silly lawsuits, or the price, or what other coins might be doing.

 
Yes, and of course will be "completely optional"... until it isn't.
> I've written more than 25K on my projects in the past 3 months. 

That's great.

Never did.   But I did start the project.

I went out of my way on reddit posts in the past when I made announcements of new versions, to give credit to others.  Anyone who is on github can see the commits.   Not sure why you feel the need for derision; it doesn't accomplish anything other than to make you look immature.
Probably best to ignore these trolls. These have no power. 12 major exchanges already made it clear the ticker is BCH.

Retweeting is pushing.  Why he retweeting it unless he is advocating implementing it? 

edit:

u/tomtomtom7  the reason I'm against Malfix isn't because it adds complexity.  It's because it changes the structure so Bitcoin is not longer a chain of signatures at the transaction level.  I understand the signatures are committed to the block but that isn't good enough for me.  In my opinion its a slipperly slope to more dangerous changes that compromise Bitcoin and the risks of going there are not at all worth the benefits.  

Also, with your regards to your complain about discussion venue:  Why is one person allowed to voice support for a proposal on Social Media (in this case Amaury tweeting) but when I voice dissent for the same proposal on social media, its not ok?

I mostly agree with you Peter.  I think the focus now should be on learning from what communication/process mistakes were made in the last 12 months with having a multi group collaborative roadmap and how we can do things better in the next 12 months. 
Good you see the truth.  Some of us have been saying this for years.
So its perfectly ok for Craig to walk out of the Bangkok meeting, not even presenting his arguments (which he seems so assured of) as to why he objects to the ABC roadmap [which nChain was compatible with in December]  (https://archive.is/gIeHO#selection-417.1-419.120)  ...and a week later it's business as usual discussing computing theory?  Why is anyone paying attention to this obvious distraction.  

Doesn't anyone else notice this? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.
You have to admit it makes more sense than Craig being the main guy in Satoshi
The main reason given for huge blocks is to support businesses who want to build, which makes sense.  Although its worth pointing out the contradiction between that goal and wanting to freeze the protocol or postpone changes or not wanting to actively discuss the technical bottlenecks.
Please.  It just adds noise. 
BCH has lower fees than BTC in satoshis / byte.

1 sat/byte goes through consistently on BCH.  It only is the case on BTC when mempool is not congested...and quite often BTC *Is* congested, at least when more people try to use it.

That's what this whole debate has been about... BCH people (real bitcoiners) do NOT WANT limits -- we want to use the blockchain without gregonomics fee market.

So, Roger is correct.




You would think the BTC community would want its user to be educated about the risks of soft forks to avoid doing one prematurely.  But just like with UASF, apparently they don't care.  They would rather act recklessly than speak badly about soft forks.  
Chainbet goes beyond provably fair.  It is also trustless.
I think that ship has sailed with segwit2x. But to your point , I don't believe bigger blocks centralize. I think second layers do 
This comment from Andy coins "So lets pretend your conspiracy is true, why do you bet against it? Because if its true that means Mainstream media will push LN/BTC" typifies the attitude of their camp.  

To them getting rich is more important than having sound money, and why not just give into evil because it has the upper hand.

It's so pointless considering you can still hedge your BTC while being outspoken for BCH.


Deadalnix is awesome
they dont get it.  and that's ok.
Not sure if you're uninformed or trolling.  Of course a node can refuse to route your payment.
>Bitcoin Cash as a brand has drawbacks, if only because it has the name Bitcoin in it and that's a liability more than an asset. Also, the confusion between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash namewise is entirely to the detriment of BCH. From a marketing standpoint it can be argued that Bitcoin Cash is not the best name.

Could not disagree more.  
I'm so glad there's multiple node implementations and teams that the miners can choose from.  
Yes, but I see much more potential for BCH than ETC.  One reason is that the choices BTC have made are worse than ETH.  Sure, the decision to revert the DAO funds goes against immutability, but the move of BTC away from being usable cash/money will hurt it more.  The second reason is that the community of BCH is very motivated and passionate.  I'm not sure about the community of ETC by comparison.
Ok more hints:

One component is simple and is related to the subject matter of the image, the other component is related to the colored pixels that have been pointed out.

Edit: a litlte surprised no one has solved this yet.... its actually hard to give more hints without giving it away, or so it seems...cough hex
great job as always Roger.

Btw, what meme is that one with the black teens?  Its awesome
the Aug 1 fork was always called Bitcoin Cash
The opposite is true. Mining can be run on small scale and make contributions to the network. Small LN hubs are useless.
I mean on r bitcoin 
I dont think whales want a spiral btc death. Better to have it die slowly
>how can there be $3000 of arbitrage?

cause no one can move BTC around.  mempool is jammed to hell
Reverse it 
Luke Rudkowski is amazing.  Glad he is on board.

shouldnt the land be for sale for whatever the buyer and seller agree to?  i dont think we need to take an authoritarian approach to promoting bitcoin cash.  that wont likely work anyway.  the world will embrace peer to peer money when it is ready.
I still have plenty of both.  I don't mind getting rich, its just a little bit dissapointing to see [bitcoin lose its censorship resistant properties.](https://news.bitcoin.com/lightning-network-centralization-leads-economic-censorship/)   Maybe the world wasn't ready just yet.  
those monopoly processors can simply refuse you send to others who arent also on aml/kyc processors.  very simple.
many or most Bitcoiners had libertarian leading ideals a few years ago.  The fact that r/bitcoin doesn't is eye opening.
I  disagree.  Most people are better off holding than trying to trade.  Trading is a difficult skill, its a zero sum game...and most who try to trade actively lose money.  It's easy to look at a chart in hindsight and say what should have been done, but there are many, many ways to go wrong.

So, the creator of bitcoin had a plan that was stupid, wrong, and damaging to bitcoin?  Interesting.  btw the fact you need to say things like "bcash" tells me you *probably* have some kind of agenda.  

Doesn't bother me.  It's cool man.  

By the way, thanks for the work on joinmarket -- I am trying it out now on electrum :)
Where in the world did you get the idea that it's not?
sad but true
if youre not verified and their auto verify isnt working and they wont let you withdrawal, yes.
They will change their tune quickly as BCC gets support. Watch.
If there was any doubt at all that Luke's coin was a shitcoin, add the fact that there will be unfair distribution as well.  Great job Luke!
so except for SW related fails...?
he could have easily done something like that.  He simply overlooked this could become a political attack vector.
darth luke jr lol
initially sw hype, then got listed on coinbase.
>Repeating the false mantra that we are "obstructionists" when we simply honestly disclose we won't follow you

Youre also not following the whitepaper and how most people assumed bitcoin would scale before Blockstream came along.
that is the number thrown out when folks argue how decentralized core is.
>Core's permission, approval, compromise, etc., is not needed.

Notice to the core developers:  We do not need you.  Your actions have proven, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that you have a biased agenda.  Therefore, your opinions, statements, theories, and conclusions are irrelevant and will be disregarded. 
Not everyone really understands the technicals.  You can't blame them for deferring to who they believe are the experts.
We need to talk about your flair, ok?  Now, its up to you  if you want to do just the bare minimum...or, well like Luke over there, for example, has got his UASF hat on, and a terrific smile. Look, people can get crypto anywhere, ok?  They come to Bitcoin  for the great features and the attitude.
you can have your own opinion , but anyone taking millions in venture capital has a certain allegiance to their backers, right?  I mean, you'd have to be a moron to deny this.  
One of the best posts ever.  We should advertise this on r/bitcoin.  I would be willing to organize such an effort.  If anyone would like to contribute, send me a message.  
i am fighting their disinfo propaganda on bitcointalk to the best of my ability.  
Feel free to provide an example.  I invite others to read my comment history and decide for themselves :)
ok Pieter... then why'd you spend months creating segwit instead of increasing the blocksize?  That wasn't any kind of decision about the network rules , right?
Well then you should get the bitcoin.  He's trying to rewrite history which is stupid...everyone knows BCH existed on Aug 1st 2017.  Let's see if he pays up.
> What authority does he have in Bitcoin if he doesn't even agree with the title of the paper or the fundamental idea it is based on?

Haha..that's funny as sh*t.  I know , right?
We're not trying to be "original".  We're trying to continue the bitcoin experiment with onchain scaling as p2p cash.
Yes. In a sense they are right. The market is authoritative in nature. However, they do not understand the simple fact that price lags behind fundamentals, and they also dont underatand the fundamenrtals themselves in this caze. So they werent necessarily wrong for writing off a depreciating asset before, but they also are right to have a newfound respect for Bitcoin Cash.
Network effect.
> For no good reason.

Sure there is.  BCH **dares** to continue the bitcoin experiment as peer to peer electronic cash.  That is an unforgivable sin.
Author of the original article here.  

Bitcoin is an idea.  It is up to each person to decide
which chain (if any) they consider "Bitcoin" or "the most Bitcoin".  For me, its still BCH.  For most of the worlds, its BTC.  And yes, there's a few people that consider BSV Bitcoin.  All that's fine.  I think after the BCH/BSV split, the case for minority chains is weakened slightly, although I still prefer BCH.

The comments here are funny. u/wagaci you are really going to go with the "blocks arent full its just spam"?  Not only is this not true, but it doesn't address capacity increases in general whatsoever.  Moreover, even IF it is true, it simply points out to a chain that is easily disrupted.

u/5heikki u/SharkLaserrrrr  you're free to believe that BSV is Bitcoin.  The fact of the matter is that both BSV and BCH are big block minority chains.  The main difference I see is the community and leadership, which are quite different.


you can use a payment channel for microtransactions.  You don't need the whole "lightning network"
>I’ve been completely disappointed with ABC 

That's a valid opinion.  ABC isn't perfect.  However, I've yet to hear a remotely convincing reason why nChain is better. 
Not sure what "gods" you're talking about.  I support Bitcoin Cash because BTC failed to scale and retain its function as peer to peer electronic cash.  
 
If we're weren't a threat to people that want to see p2p cash fail, we wouldn't have trolls like you constantly making noise.  
>  even though I did nothing immoral

Ryan, here are some facts:

1. You supported a  "hash war".  

2. This hash war has been very destructive in many ways including time, 
energy, and billions of capitalization.

3.  Your rationale was "Nakamoto Conensus" and the most proof of work should decide.

4. When SV lost, you discarded your own professed principles to continue supporting the people waging this hash war.  (ABC and BCH never supported the idea of attacking other chains).

Among other things... This is what the BCH community sees.
  
Your efforts to defend your character are wasted here.  If you want to do something good, follow through with SV and try to bring Bitcoin to the world.  Best of luck.

I guess that's a matter of opinion.  There was a 4 year scaling debate in bitcoin over small block vs big blocks.  [There was no technical debate that happened here.](https://www.yours.org/content/my-experience-at-the-bangkok-miner-s-meeting-9dbe7c7c4b2d)  Just a bunch of rich dudes trying to take over a coin. 
i think he means parker08 aka cryptorebel is saying that.
Its simple. No one who supports ABC is advocating 51% attacks or taking other actions to disrupt the SV chain.
Well they can certainly try. The higher the Bitcoin cash price the least likely it is that they will succeed in their  51% attacks (what you call defending). Good luck
According to ABC, going full CTOR was Tom's request. If true then I certainly don't understand the passive aggressiveness. Surely ABC is acting in better faith than nchain.
I'm not on twitter.  Nor your secretary :)
Seems like  a silly argument to me, because what is a subsidy and what's not is arbitrary.  

For example, take the case of using CDS in the oracle use case.  You could implement oracles via signed hashes instead of signatures.  So why isn't OP_SHA256 considered a subsidy on its primitives?  Because its already part of the code?  Also, the hash is big part of the DSA in any case, so I'm not sure the million fold number is accurate if you're not doing the hash function by hand.
A few of the CSW supporters have directly told me things like "yeah it doesn't matter if Craig walked out Bangkok or is rude, etc.  It's all about mining and that's the point he's making".   Ok, well, fine... they are entitled to that opinion but then its hypocritical to complain about not being invited to a developer summit when you've burnt every bridge.  

Also, if its all about mining and devs don't matter (as has been said by those people many times), why should this matter anyway to them?
and if ABC was against CDS, you'd probably say "they are blocking everything from BU!". 


 I think we need to judge each proposal on its own merits.

I can't speak to why GROUP didn't get consensus.  For me, it was borderline with the economics of open architecture and I can see both sides of the argument.  For CDS, it seems like its a pretty clear benefit for BCH without a downside.  

shrug
I see it somewhat differently than Ryan does. For one thing, I am not really afraid of a split.  The reasons Ryan gives for wanting to avoid a split do not consider the overwhelming likelihood that one side will get the lion's share of the economic majority and will continue being known as Bitcoin Cash.  The other side will be an altcoin.  

There's a bunch of other assumptions Ryan is making here that I don't see the same way, but I always enjoy his videos, and this one was certainly interesting.

This is the first I heard that the major adoption moving beyond just north Queensland and into queenland proper. So awesome :) Next the whole country.
Good report. Seems pretty objective .

What is surprising is that the TTOR removal seems like 90-95% of the work vs addng CTOR even though many of the compromise attempts have been based on just doing the former. 
good post.  dont forget the market is completely irrational.  It does what it wants and is not beholden to the logic of your post, no matter how sound :)
>and leave his 100+ employees out of a job.

They'll be out of a job soon regardless.  99% of users are there for the very reason they don't need to have an account.  They will find other services.
Yes it was recorded.  I don't know when and where the release are.
Impressed. Would be great to get you to code review the ABC implementation of CDS
I won't be baited into your dumb threads and trick questions.  But lest anyone thinks I'm avoiding the topic, I'll answer once for the record. "For miners or against them" is a stupid and meaningless question, as miners already defacto control the network.  I will be attempting to foster a non contentious upgrade.  In the unlikely event of a chain split, I will see where the economic majority is and act accordingly. This is all I'm going to say on this.
Thanks for pointing out what should be obvious to all but those with the lowest ability to think critically.

This is your opinion/theory.
yeah he definitely sold at the (local) high last week.  For sure not panicking now that we just broke 7k today. That's one smart dude.   /s
>The bottomline is to remind everyone that the only irreplaceable thing in bitcoin cash is it being p2p cash

Agree with that point, but the rest of your post is just stirring the pot and not even that accurate.  Amaury more than proved his worth by creating the first Bitcoin Cash software.  Have a little respect.  
terrible.
New text sections for English are there.  Yay!  There's also a video.
Meh... My gut tells me that if there was a true threat someone would just do it, not talk about it.
Does it though?  With advocates like Greg "champaign" Maxwell celebrating $50 fees and Luke "300kb" Junior, I don't think its a far flung theory to believe they actually do not want Bitcoin to be usable as cash.


SegWit never had close to 50% support before NYA (2x).

However, we should still learn from UASF because users are the ultimate bosses.  Without economic support, miners are mining a worthless coin.  It does not matter that the grassroots movement was misguided toward off-chain scaling.  It still made waves.  
great post.  Funny the "empty promises" link.  Reminds me of "breadstix IS bigger pizzas" ... They have become caricatures of themselves. 
Believe it or not, at some point the old guard will have to adopt the "if you can't beat em, join em" strategy.  I'm not saying that day is here (necessarily), but it will happen.
>I don't know about you, but I personally don't give a shit whether the paper is "plagiarized" or not as long as it actually provides a solution.

I'm not sure it does provide a solution though.  We've seen a few smart people say it doesn't.  I haven't seen anyone qualified say it does (yet)
great voice over work.  I'm impressed overall.  Great job BCF!
This has been tried before. its called Clashic.  Countless thousands of dollars spent mining a chain that has no community and no market value.  Knock yourself out.


What would you say to people who find it not entirely credible that so much money could have started to go missing without being noticed?  As the CEO, how could you not have an idea of how much money was on hand?

Every person who supports the "layer 2" core roadmap.

Nah... Blockstream CEO lying about BCH is expected and nothing new.  Some honesty from him would be the real shocker.

Which part?

>Also with a max of 20 sat/byte i imagine the wallet pretty much doesn't work with the bitcoin network right now?

Electron Cash never worked with the BTC network.  It's for Bitcoin Cash.
so $1000 fees are here already? wow. that didnt take long.
Is high prices supposed to bother me?
It is on bitfinex. I guess they hate it so much they are willing to piss off customers.  Must be getting blockstream money
Luke is secretly pro BCH now and destroying cobra.  
I always wonder why, if people are so confident about BTC, that they have to call it 'bcash'.  
Charlie must be mentally slow.  Most of us here had this "current understanding" years ago.
Agree.  It is not trustless.  It is actually based on a system of institutions trusting each other.  Why coinmarketcap continues to list is a mystery.
you mean Bitcoin: an Electronic Peer to Peer Cash System?

The fact that bitcoin cash was already attacked would give credence to my theory, so...yes.
Bitcoin just keeps getting weirder and weirder.  
>P.S. I see a lot of FUD about ElectronCash but I have yet to see any evidence the developers are hiding malicious code in the binaries and even if they are you can sign tx's offline

I'd be willing to pay a bounty for an independent audit along with a youtube video that proves there is no malicious code in the binaries.  Since it is built with pyinstaller, it should be able to be decompiled with tools like this:

I don't agree of his SW shilling.  But I've always said he's overall a good guy and Shapeshift rocks.  
This is why i won't consider Bitcoin Cash to be an "alt coin" even if it ends up with less hashpower.
soon...the bell tolls
haha... no.  Let Greg comment on github all he wants.  I doubt it will even be presented to vote.  Greg, should I start opening tickets on Bitcoin Core?  There's a lot of wrong things there, for example this 1mb block size.

its the miners' opinion that counts
