A recent CDC study published in Pediatrics provides important confirmation that flu vaccination can prevent flu deaths in children. The study found that flu vaccination reduced the risk of flu-associated death by half (51%) among children with underlying high-risk conditions and by nearly two-thirds (65%) among otherwise healthy children from 2010 through 2014. 

So you think a 65% reduction in death in healthy children is not worth it?

She still has to prove she suffered damages

Not if he's accusing her of committing a crime, which is what the complaint says. That's defamation per se. 
Thank you. When you have a conman as inept as Craig, there's a lot to work with.
Craig Wright is a serial fabricator and liar. Here's just some of the evidence:

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key signing
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)
His own mother admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
He is not technically competent in the subject matter
His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's
He called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space
He actively bought and traded coins from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
He was paid millions for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive


I don't see how manipulating "two online polls" would have any material effect on the election.

Then why would Trump use fake online polls to claim he won a debate with Hillary? Does that change your view on the value of online polling as a political tool?

Also, is this illegal? I mean, is there an actual criminal statute that Cohen violated while doing this?

Regardless of its legality, does this change your view of Trump at all?

But we have to recognize that this is the first and only president they're doing this for, and the reason seems to be less about actually clarifying the facts and more about creating an image of a president spreading falsehoods and trying to spin things to your own agenda. 

Do you think Trump does not lie significantly more than our previous presidents did?

This list is non-exhaustive...
If you can't see it on the bottom, isn't the top one more useful? It's not like it's mislabeled. 
The plagiarism is undeniable at this point (even for Craig). So, since Craig hasn't said anything about it, anyone care to guess at his response?
I think it'll be one (or more) of these:

I accidentally omitted the reference
You can't 'steal' math
This is just a case of people trying to distract from the real issues

Anything I'm not thinking of?
Edit: This comment went from +9 to +1 in two minutes!

No apology necessary for me. I never got the impression you were arguing in bad faith, which is a critical thing. It says a lot about a person who's willing to admit they made a mistake. Respect. 
Craig has absolutely zero qualms about contradictory statements. Lying is absolutely nothing to him. He even does it under penalty of perjury. 
Here's one where he swore to be a 50% shareholder in Dave Kleimain's company, and the new affidavit where he swore to never have had any ownership interest.
From the first:

The shareholding of W&K Info Defense was:


Craig S. Wright 50.0 %


David A. Kleiman 50.0 %



From the second:

I have never been a director, member, shareholder, officer, employee, or representative of W&K or of any Florida business.

Any Craig acolytes want to try to square that circle? /u/ratifythis? (aka /u/ForkiusMaximus)

The guy has no proof, he's never signed with a meaningful key

Not only that...

I think Tether is bullshit, but this report has some major red flags for me:

We vary N from 1 to 24 hours and examine the p-values. If the price action before Tether issuance is independent then the percentage changes should be uniformly drawn from the overall distribution and we should not see any p-values at or below 0.05, our chosen significance level. While this is true for the hours immediately preceding the issuance of new Tethers, there are a number of periods where the p-values are significantly below 0.05 and we reject the null hypothesis for those periods.

Uhh, you're testing 24 things and have a p-value set to 1/20, and expect nothing to be below it? 
The 'Benford's law' stuff is an interesting approach, but this line is so far off the mark that it throws the entire report into doubt for me:

In this case the test generates a p-value of 0.19, meaning that there is a 19% chance the Bittrex data conforms to the Benford’s distribution.

This is horribly wrong. 
Again, I  wouldn't touch Tether with a 100-foot pole, and our worst fears about it may be true, but I have my doubts about this particular analysis. 
Haha, yup, that was the first thing I checked.
Edit: Hijacking this top comment to point out that the explanation given in my link does not describe the way Craig did the parlor trick. It is still a parlor trick, though. Thanks to /u/nullc for pointing out the next phase of the con: 'signing' with the genesis block's key using the same method.  
Some background on Craig’s claim of being Satoshi, for the uninitiated:

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key signing
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)
He faked a bitcoin trust to get free money from the Australian government but was caught and fined over a million dollars. 

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

Seriously. Satoshi has solid grounds to sue him for defamation. 
At this point, accusing someone of being Craig Wright is de facto libel.
I take it you think Politifact is hopelessly biased? If so, can you think of a way to, as objectively as possible, measure something like this? Or do you think it's impossible to tell if someone lies more often than another?

Shameful, /u/williaminlondon

I am here. You believe this? Really?


Did you just accidentally confirm this?
Not a 'core' supporter (or detractor), but I am a 'CSW is a fraud' supporter. 
Anyway, this is crap. First (and most importantly), there's no evidence that these were Satoshi's keys. 
Second, all this 'paper' says is that it was possible to configure GPG to produce a key with the metadata shown. However, the argument wasn't that it was literally impossible. The argument was that it was exceedingly unlikely to choose those SPECIFIC 'pref-hash-algos' that just happened to be the default in a later release of the GPG software.
Edit: Highjacking this top comment to point out that the explanation given in my link does not describe the way Craig did the parlor trick. It is still a parlor trick, though. Thanks to /u/nullc for pointing out the next phase of the con: 'signing' with the genesis block's key using the same method.  
The funniest part is that even when Craig is trying to use Satoshi’s voice in an incredibly short message, his stilted ‘English’ seeps in:

I do not want to be public, but, there is an issue with SegWit. If it is not fixed, there will be nothing and I would have failed. There is only one way that Bitcoin survives and it is important to me that it works.
Important enough, that I may be known openly.

That terrible comma use is pure Craig. 

How does a porn star prove irreparable harm to their reputation

You don't need to prove reputational harm if someone accuses you of a crime. It's defamation per se. 
(The crime here would be falsely accusing someone else of a crime that didn't even happen, which Trump implied she did. It's in the complaint.)
You scooped me! Craig is so inept it hurts. 

I still believe that CSWs knowledge on the protocol is unparalleled, at the very least, the man is very knowledgeable (and confident in that knowledge) on the protocol as well as the disciplines involved within.

(The following is reproduced from an older comment I made.)
There are two ways to approach his technical ability. First, let's check the positive evidence of his technical ability. Has he shown that he's capable of producing quality technical things?
No.

There is no evidence he's even able to code. 
His PhD (which he claimed to have before 2015) was awarded in 2017. It's in a subject that's definitely not computer science and it (unsurprisingly) has basic math errors.
One of his biggest claims (in terms of technical achievement) is when he said that bitcoin's script language is Turing Complete. This is wrong.
nChain wasn't even able to implement code changes to the ABC client and had to outsource it.
He claims to have written hundreds (is it thousands yet?) of technical papers, but here's what an actual Computer Science Ph.D. says about his papers.
His patents seem to be full of plagiarized content and are of dubious validity.

So there's a lack of evidence of technical ability. On to the evidence of lack of technical ability.

His math skills are absolutely abysmal.
He claims that selfish mining doesn't even work in theory!
He doesn't understand what the CENT variable is in the bitcoin client code, though he supposedly wrote it!
He doesn't understand the current bitcoin client code.
He doesn't understand elliptic curve cryptography. (His claim and the devastating refutation.)
He makes recommendations for mining that are provably idiotic.
More (hilarious) lack of understanding of basic math. 
He didn't understand how the early bitcoin protocol worked. 
He has beginner-level misunderstandings of functions versus data types with bonus hilarious technobabble.
His pseudocode has embarrassing, beginner-level errors.
His most famous work (with Kleiman) is basically technobabble.  
The team working for him at nChain was perplexed at his lack of technical skill.
He stole other blog posts' technical content.
He plagiarized almost an entire paper, even though the stolen work didn't even apply to his thesis.
Deadalnix says Craig doesn't understand basic distributed systems concepts.
He claimed (in regard to selfish mining) that gamma could be negative, when by definition it cannot. 
People who worked for Craig think he lacks the skill to be Satoshi. 
He claimed that reserved OP codes were meant to be used in case of a future hash vulnerability, but that's utter nonsense. 
He is so technically inept that, when he faked his PGP keys, he didn't realize that using modern software would create keys that are different from the ones that would have been created in 2008.

Given that his technical skills are so obviously lacking, why does he seem able to convince some people (though nearly all bitcoin devs think he's a fraud) that he has the chops? Here is an enlightening quote from Peter Rizun:

I gave him the benefit of the doubt for a long time (even though I couldn't parse a single technical thing he ever wrote). We actually met in person once in Vancouver at a nChain office. It was this meeting that made it clear to me that he was making stuff up.
First, he told me how great my work was and suggested that we write a paper on his selfish mining findings together (as co-authors). I said something like "I'm pretty sure you're wrong and that Eyal & Sirer are perfectly correct. But, I'd still like to try to understand your argument for why selfish mining is a fallacy."
He walked me over to a whiteboard, and then proceeded to scribble a few blocks connected as a chain. He looked at me and said something oddly technical: "You're obviously familiar with the properties of Erlang and negative binomial distributions."
That's the point I knew he was a bullshitter. He intentionally asked the question in a way designed to make me feel dumb so that I might be too embarrassed to answer 'no.' I responded "Not really."
He smirked and half laughed.
I then said "but I am very familiar with the math required to understand selfish mining, let's work together on the board." I proceeded to try get to a point where we agreed on even a single technical thing about bitcoin mining, but it was impossible. I said "OK, let's imagine a selfish miner solves a block and keeps it hidden. Do you agree that the probability that he solves the next block is equal to his fraction of the hash rate, alpha?"
He retorted: "Well that's sort of true but its really just an approximation. You're not looking at the problem from the proper perspective of IIDs."
I replied back "What's an IID?"
He laughed to himself again, this time louder, and told me that he had assumed my math skills were better than what I was presenting to him. He said IIDs are "processes that are independent and identically distributed."
I replied back: "Oh, you mean like how mining is memoryless, right? Yeah, I understand processes like that. So OK forget about the hidden block, do you agree that the probability that the selfish miner finds the next block is equal to alpha?"
And again he would say something like "Peter, you obviously don't understand IDDs and negative binomials, but I have a paper coming out soon that will help you to understand what I'm saying." And I'm thinking to myself that he hasn't actually said anything at all.
The conversation went nowhere for a while like this with him dropping technobabble terms like it was going out of style. At the end, we had not agreed on a single technical fact about bitcoin mining. I wondered why he drew those blocks on the whiteboard, since he never actually referenced them in the conversation, but I decided not to ask.

Craig's actual skill lies in social manipulation. 
I understand, but do you think there’s a way to determine who lies more often than another if so many sources seem to be ‘biased’?
Also, is this a lie?

The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.


Gun rights is probably more of a facts/knowledge based argument. For example, lots of gun death statistics include suicides which should be excluded when debating gun violence but often are not excluded.

I strongly disagree here. If anything, gun rights is up there with religion as a 'value-based' stance. 
Do you really think that if there were indisputable data showing that more guns result in more (non-suicide) violence, that gun advocates would suddenly want to turn in their guns? Of course not. The argument would change to personal freedom versus collective good, or something like that. 
Let's face it: people just like guns. They want to keep their guns. This is not a data argument.  
As a separate issue, I'm not sure why people think gun suicide should not 'count' at all. If gun availability increases the suicide rate (by making it quick and easy), then why should that not be part of the discussion on whether guns are 'worth it'?
This is the ultimate straw man. Something can be clearly a forgery even if you can’t prove it with mathematical certainty. Your whole point revolves around, “well, it wasn’t literally impossible to make those keys in 2008!” 
It’s also not literally impossible that Michael Phelps is Satoshi, but it’s about as likely as those keys being genuine. People can safely say, “they are clearly a forgery.”

In fact, you cannot say for certain if it was or was not updated at any point 

It’s pretty clear that they weren’t updated after creation. 
Anyway, for anyone interested in actual facts about Craig, see here. 
Assuming the allegation is true, does it change your opinion of Trump at all?
Well it all makes sense when you realize he’s a lying fraud who desperately wants CDS to fail because it makes his patents even more worthless than they already are. 
And Vitalik Buterin, and basically every other technical person involved in crypto. 
Just add it to the list. Does anyone doubt at this point that Craig is a complete fraud?

This proves above anything else, this guy is not Satoshi.

This is just another drop in the ocean of evidence that he's not Satoshi:

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key signing
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)
His own mother admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
He is not technically competent in the subject matter
His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's
He called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space
He actively bought and traded coins from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
He was paid millions for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive

Reminds me of a quote from Liar Liar:

Fletcher: Your Honor, I object!
Judge: Why?
Fletcher: Because it's devastating to my case!
Judge: Overruled.


Well it's clearly a false statement. I think Trump spoke on Fox and Friends and made it clear that his accusation against China was a joke.

How do you know this wasn’t a post hoc rationalization? How do you tell generally? Is there always a bright line? What if someone is just wrong rather than intentionally lying? Is it possible to be 100% objective in determining these things?
What do make of the fact Politifact shows that Trump lies (proportionally) more than Obama by a huge amount? All bias?
I even left off a bunch of stuff. The amount of unintentional comedy this guy produces is incredible.
I’ve become somewhat of a connoisseur of Craig excuses, so permit me to predict his response. It’ll almost certainly be one of three:


When I started the Bitcoin paper, I used an older draft of the Blacknet whitepaper that had those mistakes. I realized it before I publicly released Bitcoin. 


One of my team members screwed it up and I had to revert the changes. 


It was purposeful ‘troll bait’. 


I think the first is the most likely. Of course, it’s utter bullshit, since, as /u/jstolfi points out, the blacknet abstract is nonsense anyway. 
Paging /u/cryptorebel 

Ben Shapiro holds a degree from Harvard in constitutional law. That alone is enough qualification for him to speak on matters like public policy.

OP didn't say he wasn't qualified to speak, only that he presents as an entertainer does:

They can be very smart people. They might have very intelligent things to say about a subject matter. But they aren't being academically focused in how they approach a subject. 

.

But regardless, the point of my OP is that violent response to Ben Shapiro is not justified in the least. 

Your title is only that there is no reason to "disrupt" a speech. Not all disruptions are violent. It's a fairly banal CMV if you limit it to "we shouldn't try to violently attack him".
TL;DW: Yes, but it's a bit cramped.
It's a log scale. I'm not sure why.
Well, it's been over an hour without any attempts. For anyone waiting, I'll save you some time and get the usual stuff out of the way:

"Yawn."
"So you're the judge and jury now?"
"It's part of a bigger strategy that you cannot comprehend."
"You haven't verified these documents."
"This is only one side of the story."
"Of course Satoshi is evasive. He'll rot in jail if he's ever caught."
"None of this matters. The only thing that matters is that he's locking down the protocol."

Hypothetical: if every single women's event is dominated by women with hyperandrogenism (eg - the top 10 in every event in all the world championships and olympics), would you consider making a separate category just for them, or forcing them to compete with men, or making them take testosterone suppressants? Or would it not bother you?
Maybe there should be a class action lawsuit among BSV holders against Craig for tanking their coin.
Though, to be fair, it'd probably be Craig and Calvin just suing themselves.
It looks like SV controls about a maximum of 3.75 exahash on BCH (though they may have more 'parked' on BTC or just sitting idle) out of a total of about 5 exahash. 
If the bitcoin.com hashrate stays the same, it'll represent around 0.8 to 1 exahash moving from BTC to BCH, which would mean that SV's control would fall from about 75% to about 63%. It'd take about another 1.5 exahash to get SV under 50%. 
Again, this is all assuming that no other changes happen and SV isn't 'hiding' hashpower. 
Point taken. At this point, I'm mostly doing this for my own personal amusement. However, I suppose there still is a small minority who are still taken in.
So, anyone reading who wants serious evidence rather than this amusing anecdote, here it is:

He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key-signing (actually he faked two)
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)

His pseudocode has embarrassing, beginner-level errors.
His most famous work (with Kleiman) is basically technobabble.  
The team working for him at nChain was perplexed at his lack of technical skill.
He stole other blog posts' technical content.
He plagiarized almost an entire paper, even though the stolen work didn't even apply to his thesis.
He claimed (in regard to selfish mining) that gamma could be negative, when by definition it cannot. 
People who worked for Craig think he lacks the skill to be Satoshi. 
He claimed that reserved OP codes were meant to be used in case of a future hash vulnerability, but that's utter nonsense. 
He is so technically inept that, when he faked his PGP keys, he didn't realize that using modern software would create keys that are different from the ones that would have been created in 2008.

This list is non-exhaustive...

Well yes, politifact is known to be biased

Do you have objective evidence that there’s systematic bias (ie - not just a couple of examples)?
What about when something is wrong, but not by much? If someone says something has increased by 20%, when it actually increased by 23%, is that a lie? Who decides? 
One of Kleiman's attorneys 'liked' a Twitter post on the topic.
For the uninitiated:

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key signing
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)
He faked a bitcoin trust to get free money from the Australian government but was caught and fined over a million dollars. 

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
He is not technically competent in the subject matter
His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's
He called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space
He actively bought and traded coins from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
He was paid millions for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive
He plagiarized and backdated the bitcoin whitepaper abstract to pretend he wrote it.


The topic was whether Craig is Satoshi Nakamoto

Since that's the topic, this is relevant.
Craig Wright is a serial fabricator and liar. Here's just some of the evidence:

Information widely distributed in popular media is saying that this year’s vaccine is about 17% effective.

Which refers to how many people get the flu, not how severe it is. There is strong evidence that, even when not perfectly matched, the flu vaccine reduces severity and deadliness of the flu.

Add to that dismal statistic that a small percentage of children have a bad reaction to the vaccine

Can you give any more detail to this hand-wavy cost-benefit analysis? 

And medical professionals need to come together to make sure a coherent message gets out to help inform parents with reliable and actionable info.

Yes, they have! The annual flu vaccine is recommended for healthy people 6 months and older! (And other populations as well.)

If the vaccine is that important, why isn’t it mandatory like others?

This is a bizarre argument. I'm not sure there are any mandatory vaccinations in the US to begin with. Usually it's a state-specific policy that has to do with enrolling in public schools. 
Given the recent data available, I expect annual flu shots to become mandatory (in that way) in some states. 
Looks like someone tipped him 25 BCH last night. Impressive! That’s over $12,000 USD. 
Wow, even after two fake public signings, Ryan persists in this ridiculous belief. What a perfect demonstration of the power of delusion. 
/u/ryancarnated, it appears that you’re beyond help at this point. 

my understanding was that Peter, Emin, and Vitalik were all ridiculing the math that turns out to be from an established paper

He didn't plagiarize all of the math, only most of it. The math he didn't plagiarize was ridiculed. The math that he did plagiarize wasn't relevant to his argument. 
Clear?
Unsurprisingly, he cites no actual evidence, but instead relies on the opinions of other people.
Maybe the funniest part of the video is where he asserts that the only way to 'disprove that Craig is Satoshi' is to prove that someone else is Satoshi. 
This is ridiculous for several reasons, the most obvious being that this wouldn't even constitute the type of 'final proof' he thinks it would. Borrowing a page from the Craig apologists, we could hypothesize that the new 'real Satoshi' is simply a fall-guy whom Craig paid to 'take the heat'. 
The fact is that it's impossible to prove real-world identity with mathematical certainty. But we don't need that. Evidence that establishes that Craig is not Satoshi far beyond a reasonable doubt is enough to make a firm conclusion. 
/u/ryancarnated Why do you consistently ignore the evidence against Craig?
Ah, what a perfect example of an argument in bad faith. You might as well post the whole discussion we had, where you used a statement I made well before BCH even existed as proof of my current thoughts and an implicit smear. 
I clarified my stance later in that discussion, yet you still are trying to smear me in bad faith.
Bottom line: no, I am still undecided in the matter, and I've never misrepresented my thoughts or opinions. 
Why would a so-called master at making deals (Trump) pay for something worthless? Does this at least change your opinion of his savvy as a good decision-maker?
Many high-visibility, pro-nChain accounts have suddenly turned on Peter. /u/geekmonk, /u/btcnewsupdates, /u/higher-plane, /u/poorbrokebastard, etc. It's almost as if it's coordinated. 
I await the torrent of downvotes from these 'totally organic' users.
I appreciate the skepticism. You're free to verify it yourself by scrolling down to item 144 (Judgment on the Pleadings) and click 'buy on PACER' like I did. It'll cost a few bucks.
I think this post hit a nerve. Craig seems even testier than normal. Maybe his bosses and coworkers at nChain are finally coming to terms?
/u/shadders333 /u/danconnolly , any comment?

nChain released Nakasendo last week, in case you missed it

He literally linked it in the comment.

CSW is neither toxic

OK, how do you respond to this?

Translated to useful information:
The full block was 1.3 MB. The stripped version that gets sent to legacy nodes (ie - non SegWit supporting) was 872 KB. 
The stripped version still includes the SegWit transactions, but there is no witness data included for those transactions. So even if the OP is considering SegWit transactions to be 'not bitcoin', then they're still wrong, since it would be less than 872 KB without the SegWit transactions entirely.
More data available here.

It does seem as though it was used that way on multiple occasions, but we dont have any substantive evidence in front of us and I am unwilling to just take their word

There has been significant evidence for a long time. Do you not consider that 'substantive'? If not, why?
Up by +3 in Florida according to new Gravis poll. (HRC 49 - DT 46)

Craig's an utter fraud. Even his mom thinks he's a bullshitter.
Anyone wanting evidence of how much of a fraud he is, see here for an incomplete (but still overwhelming) list of facts about Nakamoto Dundee.
My god, you're going to double-down even on this?? In addition to my link, here are more sources for you to peruse.
Everything Craig does is hilariously slapdash and amateurish. He didn't bother checking timestamps of his blog posts when he faked them. He didn't bother downloading an older version of gpg when he faked his PGP keys. He constantly contradicts things Satoshi said. It's a never-ending comedy show.
Am I correct in assuming that you're implying that this bad decision was due to his technical illiteracy? 
Beyond that, nothing about it gives you pause about the type of person who'd pay to rig a poll?
If the same story came out about Obama, would you have a similar (non) reaction?

Mr. Wanker is not even a particularly good predator. That's what's seriously annoying about this.

YES.
Yes, of course it goes on my list. Does it matter who literally invented it? Satoshi wrote the code for it.

Only 20% get the vaccine. 

Did you pull this completely out of your ass, or just mostly? Try closer to 60%.

Segregated witness separates/removes signatures from a transaction. 

SegWit separates the signatures from the transaction hash, not the transaction itself!

They no longer count in the block size, if I understand correctly.

Incorrect. They are discounted in the block weight, which replaces the concept of block size. Non-witness data counts as 4 units of weight, and witness data counts as 1 unit of weight.

Where do the signatures go to. Are they no longer in the block? 

They are in the block, right along with the transactions, just as before.

Are they downloaded separately?

Here's the crux of people's confusion. Fully upgraded SegWit nodes see the whole block. Un-upgraded nodes are sent a stripped block without witness data so that it can fit in the block size limit. Otherwise, they'd see larger blocks (> 1MB) and reject them. The old nodes would not know how to deal with the witness data anyway, so it doesn't make sense to send it. However, if those nodes upgrade, they will have full access to the chain of signatures in every block!

Are they no longer computed in the block merkle tree?

The transactions still show up in the normal merkle tree, but the witness data isn't hashed with the transaction, so it does not. However, the witness data is included in a new merkle tree that's recorded in the coinbase transaction (the miner reward transaction). So they are available for everyone to verify. 
In summary, if you have a fully upgraded node, all signature data is available forever. If you are not upgraded, you won't know what that signature data means and would ignore it, so it is not sent to you.
Does it matter who literally invented it? Satoshi wrote the code for it.

Except walls do work. Obama gave money to Jordan to build a wall [1]. 

Does Obama giving money to Jordan mean all walls work? I'm not sure what the logic is here.

Hungary built a wall and successfully stopped most illegal immigration [2].

Do you honestly think this is a fair comparison? The 'wall' described includes "soldiers, dogs, thermal cameras and 3,000 newly recruited border police officers". Moreover, there are more alternative countries for migrants to seek out, so the wall may have only redirected the traffic, unlike in the US, where migrants don't have other options.  

I prefer the billions we save from stopping illegal immigration.

This is far from clear. Do you have any solid data to back up your argument? 

This is more opinion than fact.

If that's what you think, then isn't your claim that it'll 'save billions' also more opinion than fact? 
You'd need to know some of the back story, but, in a nutshell, in 2013, Craig was trying to get free money from the Australian government through a tax credit program, and he needed to make it look like he spent a lot of money on 'research and development'. He picked some high-balance addresses and pretended that was money he spent.
He faked owning a supercomputer a couple years later in a related scam.
Classic Craig move. First, he has no problem with lying under oath, as he's done it at least twice already. 
Second, this is pure posturing. There’s practically  zero chance that he’ll be deposed or otherwise face legal consequences for this. And even if he did, the onus would be on the authorities to disprove that he’s Satoshi. He wouldn’t be ‘forced to sign’ or anything like that. No prosecutor would care enough to take this case. 
Third, this is part of his strategy of having his footprints everywhere. He’s trying to Gish gallop the subject, and that’s been the strategy from the beginning. That’s how Ian Grigg was bamboozled. He produces prodigious amounts of bullshit and relies on the confusion to convince people. 
If anyone’s been paying attention, he’s been laying the groundwork all along for never ‘signing’ anything. Try reading this with a straight face. 
Most worthless airdrop in history. 
But... but...  but...
NO SPLIT!
Well, if you want to add your name to the list of easily duped, nobody will stop you. 
The fact that Craig literally admitted faking a blog post from this same blog makes me a bit skeptical that this is genuine. Note that the archive link is from 2015, which is well after he started his hoax.
SegWit and a ton of other potential improvements to bitcoin, including non-delayed UTXO commitments, committed bloom filters, committed address indexes, non-delayed STXO commitments, weak blocks, and most kinds of fraud proofs.  
Imagine someone discovered a similar 'attack' that improved mining efficiency by a ton, but prevented bitcoin from ever increasing the blocksize limit. All miners quickly adopt it, essentially forever preventing a blocksize increase. Tell me you wouldn't cry foul. 
It’s a joke! :) It’s a frequent retort Craig uses on Twitter. Maybe I should have made it more explicit. 
Your calculation is off by an order of magnitude. Should be 0.4%. 
/u/MemoryDealers, will you do it?
Actually, I find him quite funny. He's not intentionally funny, but I get a lot of amusement out of him.

There's a bloody picture out there of you smiling and drinking wine next to him

Here, for anyone interested. 

Where were you when people in this sub where calling him out?

I can back this up.

You were notably silent until it affected you financially. 

He's still notably silent, even though he could do something. In fact, I still haven't seen him explicitly say that Craig is not Satoshi.
✔ Sloppy and obvious plagiarism
✔ Backdated document
✔ Proof 'to come' in some indeterminate time
This is peak Faketoshi. 
How can /u/shadders333 and /u/danconnolly work for someone like this? 
That’s definitely cryptorebel. 
Yes.
Any reason you never mention Craig's fake blog posts? Do you only ask softball questions? 
The best part about all this is that we know Craig is reading all of these comments roasting him. 

getting the flu shot basically trains your body to target those particular strains of the flu but it also weakens your immune response to other strains which would make this years flu shot less than effective

Yeah, this is BS. 

A recent CDC study published in Pediatrics provides important confirmation that flu vaccination can prevent flu deaths in children. The study found that flu vaccination reduced the risk of flu-associated death by half (51%) among children with underlying high-risk conditions and by nearly two-thirds (65%) among otherwise healthy children from 2010 through 2014. 

Does it matter who invented it? Satoshi wrote the base58 code.
This is a strong conclusion for someone who still believes Craig “was part of Satoshi.” However, let’s keep in mind that he was not part of Satoshi. He wasn’t even involved in bitcoin at all prior to about 2013. 
He is just a serial fabricator and liar. Here's just some of the evidence:

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key signing
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)
His own mother admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
He is not technically competent in the subject matter
His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's
He called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space
He actively bought and traded coins from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
He was paid millions for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive

Bravo! 
He's also an admitted sockpuppeteer and vote manipulator. 
Edit: More proof than just a screenshot:
Found it. Also, redditsearch.io seems to have it archived, even though it was deleted. See the fourth result. 
Bonus proof.
This is part of his affidavit, and here is his signature. 
The whole thing is also available.
No, this is, in fact, at least the third different type of fake signing that Craig has tried.
The fake signings for Gavin, Matonis, and the press were done using Electrum, where he supposedly 'signed' a plaintext message they gave him. That was almost certainly done with a patched version of Electrum, which would be trivial to do, even for someone as incompetent as Craig. As for the 'clean computer' he used for Gavin, he could have simply copied his hacked version of Electrum over when he copied his 'keys'. Gavin even admitted he didn't take any steps to verify the copy of Electrum:

if we were running an Electrum that reported 'verified' for any message ending with 'CSW' and not verified for anything else that would fit what happened. I didn't bring checksums of Electrum downloads with me.

The second fake signing just reused an existing signature, but lied about what a message hashed to. 
The method described by /u/nullc is his third attempt. 
How many fake signings does it take to get to the center of a Craig believer? The world may never know. (/u/ratifythis, maybe you want to answer?)
It’s not English; it’s Craiglish. 
OK, Roger. Here's a logical, coherent argument that Craig is not Satoshi, like you appear to believe:

Whitepaper and forum posts are nothing like Craig's style (ask Peter Rizun!)
Wrong timezone to make all the forum posts Satoshi did. The whitepaper PDF also indicated a US timezone.
Provably backdated PGP keys that Craig claimed were legitimate
COMPLETELY FAKED blog posts showing his early involvement with bitcoin
Calling bitcoin 'Bit Coin' several times in 2011
Gross technical incompetence. Also here. And here.
No evidence of C++ proficiency despite many detailed resumes available
He was paid millions of dollars by nTrust to 'reveal' himself as Satoshi (this is for those who think he lacked 'motive')
Pretended to be 'outed by hackers' but that's been debunked. Hackers supposedly 'released' the fake Tulip Trust document, but that's the very document that contains Craig's FAKED PGP keys that he defended! 

Character matters. Hypocrisy matters. 
By the way, it’s the same user who has been user-tag-spamming /u/nullc and /u/adam3us.
I approve this message. Two thumbs up!
Why leave out his reply? Because it’s obviously a lie. It’s been almost 18 months and there’s nothing. Like usual, he’s full of shit. 
He’s still wrong about Selfish Mining. I can explain it to you slowly if you’d like. 

I’m curious if there is any significant mathematical work that he has authored that he has not plagiarized.

That's the easiest way to find his plagiarism. He's incapable of expressing mathematical reasoning in different form or notation (he'd have to understand it first!), so he can't do his usual tricks of slightly rewording the text. 

CSW has a million BCH and BTC

Lol, no. 
First, the 'actual mathematical proof CSW posted' is plagiarized.
Second, it does not 'refute THE MODEL'. The entire point of 'the mathematics' his paper is to try to show that the SM cannot get more than alpha of ALL BLOCKS SOLVED (not that SM cannot get more than alpha of the blocks that end up on the blockchain). 
It's even in the abstract:

The mathematics presented in this paper demonstrate that no “gambling scheme” or system can be
constructed to increase the odds of calculating a block.

This is not even in dispute, so it appears that Craig is furiously fighting a strawman with the math. 
Do you say this because you got caught using a sockpuppet yourself?
Edit: Wow, you're still at it.
Not sure if you're arguing for veganism or if this is just plain whataboutism. 
Thanks for testing. Those accounts are definitely sockpuppets. They're so bad that they overflow my p-value calculation. Fixed.

ease of genital hygiene

But you just have to wash yourself! Personal responsibility! 

diminished risk of disease

You know what else reduces disease???? Condoms! And you don't have to lop off the top of your penis to wear a condom. Just because people don't actually wear them and end up dying from penile cancer or AIDS doesn't mean circumcision has health benefits. Along the same lines, I only wish people would realize that abstinence is the most effective and easy form of avoiding unwanted pregnancy, and therefore all other methods are unnecessary... 
/s
Craig's new tack about "Bitcoin was purposely designed not to be anonymous" is pretty funny. It directly shows he's not Satoshi.
First, having Bitcoin participants be 'anonymous' is literally on the first announcement from Satoshi.
Second, he reaffirms its importance again and again.
Third, he even says that Bitcoin would be better if it didn't need every transaction to be public.
Here's Craig:

"I worked on Bitcoin for a long time before I found something that would not be able to be used in a manner that was anonymous."
...
"I designed Bitcoin to create an immutable evidence trail, money that is private and yet does not suffer the fate of Gyges. Anonymity is a curse. Nothing good comes of it."

Compare that to the real Satoshi:

"If a solution was found [to avoid creating a public graph of every transaction], a much better, easier, more convenient implementation of Bitcoin would be possible."

I mean, he conclusively states that the only reason for the 'public ledger' is to prevent double-spends:

"It's the need to check for the absence of double-spends that requires global knowledge of all transactions."

A couple messages later he says:

"What we need is a way to generate additional blinded variations of a public key ... Then you need to be able to sign a signature such that you can't tell that two signatures came from the same private key.  I'm not sure if always signing a different blinded public key would already give you this property.  If not, I think that's where group signatures comes in.  With group signatures, it is possible for something to be signed but not know who signed it."
"As an example, say some unpopular military attack has to be ordered, but nobody wants to go down in history as the one who ordered it.  If 10 leaders have private keys, one of them could sign the order and you wouldn't know who did it."

So, Satoshi was highly interested in transaction anonymity and leaving out 'immutable evidence trails'. This is basically how Monero works. 
Craig's a moron.

Dems believed a wall would help Jordan.

So?

Hungary has a GLORIOUS wall which effectively limited illegals from entering their GREAT country.

What's glorious about it? Also, why did you ignore my point about migrants having more options in Europe? Do you think it would be as effective if Hungary were their only option?

Yes. Our wall will be better. We have way more agents, dogs and technology than Hungary.

... and way more border, right? Also, as I've mentioned, and you've ignored, the US is many migrants' only option, so the reason it's not a fair comparison is that they're not as motivated to get into Hungary as they would be to the US.

Absolutely! Feel free to use your favorite search engine to find the countless studies and data out there.

So the ones that show all immigration as a net positive for the economy are also valid? What do you think of those?

No, because there is data out there to confirm it is a fact.

How do you reconcile the studies that show that immigration (both legal and illegal) are net positives for the US economy versus those that  show it's a net negative? 
Ah, a classic.

I frankly do not care about plagiarism. Who does?

People with a modicum of integrity?
The funny thing is that Phil might actually be trying to extort Craig. It's like watching one Nigerian Prince try to scam another. 
Here's part of an email Phil says he sent to Craig:

You [Craig] said that half of the generated Bitcoins that you'd mined over the couple of active years on the project are mine [Scronty's] when I ask for them ...
I told you to hold them for me for five years and, if necessary, to store them on a USB stick and place into a trust

...

I accept that half of the Bitcoins you've had to spend (including when you attempted to create an Aussie Bitcoin Bank) were mine and have been consumed for the good of the project.
My claim would only hold for splitting the remaining Bitcoin.

He then goes on to talk about how he's planning on publicly releasing details of their 'collaboration' and that he'd like Craig's input. 
My best guess is that he is (or was) auditioning for the 'unnamed third Satoshi team member', but would like to be paid for his efforts. However, he could also be just subtly threatening to release 'damaging' information unless Craig pays him. 
Either way, Phil is a liar and so is Craig. Neither had anything to do with Satoshi. 
All right. 
There's a good reason why physicists don't waste time debating Deepak Chopra's 'positions' on quantum theory. 
/u/tippr gild Definitely going on the list. 
No, the vast majority are not car-specific. Tesla's superchargers are the exception. 
This is a non-sequitur. 

Humans alone have free will (which you equate with 'capability of rationality' for some reason.)
Therefore we are 'objectively worth more' ?!

I think you've omitted some axioms. You're literally defining 'worth' as 'capability of rationality', which is just plain weird. Followed to its conclusion, you'd have no problem torturing non-human animals just for kicks, assuming it wouldn't lead to torturing humans. This is an odious view.
So your theory is that Kleiman set his computer's time to a year and a half in the future for some reason and it just happened to be right before Craig reinstated Uyen as a director in Kleiman's company almost a year after he died?
Wow.
That still doesn't explain why the key itself is fake, anyway. 

Also, how do we know the document you linked is legit?

I appreciate the skepticism. You're free to verify it yourself by scrolling down to item 144 (Judgment on the Pleadings) and click 'buy on PACER' like I did. It'll cost a few bucks.
Yeah, I know. 
At least he’s somewhat come around. I’d obviously prefer a more full-throated statement from him. 

You must not travel much.

I travel enough that I doubt I'd ever describe a 10-foot barbed-wire fence as GLORIOUS. Do you think most 10-foot barbed-wire fences are GLORIOUS?

Which explains why a wall is needed more than ever.

Again, the issue is about effectiveness. You're trying to prove that walls are effective by using an inapt comparison. Do you understand why it's an invalid argument?

I haven't found any reliable studies about illegals (which being an illegal is a crime in and of itself.

Here's one. And here's another. 
Craig Wright’s a helluva drug. 
The dude talking to Craig is pretty funny. For once, someone is not being a complete pushover. CC: /u/the_bch_boys 
Are we betting $10 or something else about getting off of subreddits?
If it's the former, I'll happily accept. If it's the latter, that doesn't make sense, because there's no upside for me. 
So, to be clear, on December 15, I will send you $10 if Bitcoin SV is the dominant chain in price and hashrate (payment will occur on the Bitcoin SV chain). If ABC is the dominant chain in price and hashrate, you pay me $10 (on the ABC chain). Otherwise, the bet is cancelled.
Sound good?
/u/memorydealers, now is it time yet?

My on thoughts on if CSW is Satoshi or not are private until if and when I decide to make them public.

LOL, nice false dichotomy. I'm not accusing him of copyright infringement (a legal issue). I'm accusing him of lack of integrity and academic fraud. 
ELI5: Bitcoin software does not process new transactions in parallel very well currently (if you have a machine with many cores, it'll usually only use one). Some people described this behavior as 'single-threaded', but it's not quite technically accurate, though the result is almost the same.
Imagine if you had a crew of construction workers (multiple threads) but only one shovel. 'Single-threaded' would imply that you have one construction worker, but the fact that you have a bottleneck of only one shovel means that it's basically the same result.
In late 2011, he referenced "Bit Coin" a few times in this post. It appears he just cut-and-paste a generic description of it.
He bought and traded bitcoins on Mt.Gox in 2013 and 2014. 
Edit: Why in the world is this downvoted?
What you're looking at was his 'proof'. His lawyer scrolled down on Craig's phone to 'verify' it.

I would much prefer an article that cites the concrete evidence (like the check in this article) and the business law and any relevant precidents related to the case

Doesn't the article do just that? It gives evidence of payments, discusses the law, and cites expert opinion. I'm not sure what else you'd want. 

This article doesnt build a substantive case as much as it trys to present a timeline of unlitigated or settled cases as evidence.

Of course they'd be unlitigated. How could we be discussing it otherwise? The settled cases are evidence of unlawful actions because they were paid by the foundation, which is illegal. 
Thank you for reminding me. 
For the uninitiated:

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key signing
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)

His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's
He called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space
He actively bought and traded coins from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
He was paid millions for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive

How could I have missed that one?!
The volume is incredibly low at the moment. It's under $1,000 USD total, so don't draw any conclusions until this rises by a huge amount. 
Hahaha, nice catch!
Wrong. 
 
Bye troll

Birth control is acceptable and we have laws allowing for people to use birth control. Divorce is also legal. Sex between an unmarried man and woman is legal. Gambling is legal in some designated areas. Gay and lesbian relations are legal. Having a baby outside of marriage is legal. Stem cell research is regulated but definitely allowed. The list goes on.

A significant portion of this list used to be illegal or at least significantly burdened legally, which shows that the movement to more liberal viewpoints actually does lead to change in laws. So, to me, this seems to support the OP's notion. 

When you ask the question when will our laws reflect this, do you think our laws forbid many of these activities now? Because that's not the case.

You already qualified gambling and stem cell research, so you know that it is the case that the laws have room to change, even for these issues. There are several that you ignored, like the death penalty, doctor-assisted suicide, polygamy, human cloning, and animal medical testing that currently have laws that could be changed if opinions continue to shift. 

Also to be clear, a majority of people supporting something doesn't make that thing okay or productive.

OP's post didn't really address the normative aspect of the laws. They just asked how long Supporters think it will be before the laws reflect the shifting views. 

Having a child out of wedlock or being a single mother might be more supported in society, but that doesn't mean that the child and mother don't face strains and that the child would be statistically better off in a two-parent household. Gambling might have a majority approval rating, but that doesn't mean that it stops being addictive and takes advantage of those who are less efficient with their money.

The obvious argument is that prohibiting these activities has worse outcomes than allowing them, like with prohibition. It's practically certain that alcohol has a net negative effect on society, yet we've learned that making it illegal is even worse. So, from a utilitarian viewpoint (which it seems like you're taking), it certainly may be the case that these more liberal laws will be the better of the choices. 
It’s so bad, Craig’s own mom has to call him on his bullshit. 
Wow, and you make over $200k a year? I hope it's not math-related. Let's see:
You're using the marginal federal tax rate. I guarantee you're significantly lower than that. Unless you spend everything you earn on taxable goods and services, you can't include that 6% sales tax. SSA only applies to the first $109k or so. And your real-estate tax of $15k is largely by choice; you could certainly live in a smaller home. Even including it, you're almost certainly below 50%. 
I made $685k last year and paid under 40% TOTAL tax (fed, state, local, real estate, SSA, you name it). That's all normally taxed income (ie - no capital gains). 
I think it's great that you support OWS, but spreading misinformation about how much the rich pay in taxes is not helping the cause.

Do you feel like NN are all immoral bigots that are out there to get you?

No. I'm simply trying to understand the level of immorality you're willing to tolerate. I don't assume you represent all Trump voters. And you, yourself, wrote that you don't support him because he's 'moral', which implies that you're willing to overlook a certain level of immorality. It doesn't hurt that Trump himself boasted about the slavishness of his supporters when he said, "I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any voters".
If underhandedly paying cash to rig a poll doesn't even seem to register on your radar, I'm curious what would.
Thus, the question: what type of act would be beyond the pale for you? Is anything up to actual criminal activity acceptable? Are certain crimes acceptable? 
So, do you think he's lying about this?
Also, are you familiar with the concept of a statement against interest? Does that adequately explain why some non-supporters may feel differently about this situation? 
Nice, but I think that's covered by:

It's part of a bigger strategy that you cannot comprehend.


Yes, of course. What else was left? Not apologizing?

Wasn't the point of your original comment an implicit accusation of me being hypocritically unable to admit mistakes? Well, this is proof that I absolutely am able to admit to mistakes and have, ironically in the very discussion you're referring to.

I'm just going to use one example: the flu.

....

That is a barrier that could never be reached for [any] vaccination

I assume you see the fallacy here? 

vaccines are not 100% reliable

...

Our legal standards of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt would rule that out.

Considering reasonable doubt is not quantifiable (purposely) and is left up to the fact finders (ie - the jury) to decide, I'm not sure how you are coming to this conclusion. Do you think DNA tests, witness recollection, etc. are 100% reliable?

I am not adverse.

You mean averse. 
The black son story was debunked many years ago with a DNA test. Where is the evidence that this rape claim is because of 'the Clinton machine'? The accuser originally filed a claim in May.

but the whole point of these charities is to act as a family checking account.

There are totally different laws that apply to a normal checking account and a charity, not to mention tax differences. He appears to have not respected those laws on a number of occasions. He may not be 'laundering' money in a legal sense, but he's taking tax deductions illegally. 
Pointed out a fraud. 

This omission changes the entire narrative from a true act of charity into a narcissistic misuse of funds. It is probable that the painting has zero commercial value.

The artist has several similarly styled paintings on his website for sale for over $10,000. Where did you come up with "zero"? If the painting had any significant value, and it was displayed in Trump's property, then it would violate the self-dealing laws. That appears to be what happened. 

If the writers know this it is an intentional omission meant to disparage if they dont know then they are extremely bad at research.

The same author wrote both articles. 

To paint this as fraud is a complete misrepresentation.

It's simply another example of the type of self-dealing that his foundation has a pattern of doing. Is it the most egregious? No. Was it legal? No. 
Do you have any view on the other, much more egregious, examples given?
Baggypants worked at nChain himself. 
He's right but for the wrong reasons. There's no way this guy knows who Satoshi is. 
Paging /u/shadders333 and /u/danconnolly. Can you translate what your boss is saying, please? Is this going to be part of consensus code? Is the spec going to be available to all and open for public comment?
Who's saying he has to answer? The evidence speaks for itself, and has for a long time.

What a shame you love to lie 

Oh the irony! Remember when you said you were going to provide ‘extraordinary proof’ that you were Satoshi?
And do you remember the time you faked a bitcoin trust and the Australian government caught you and fined you over a million AUD? Good times. 
Oh, and the time you faked a blog post that made it look like you were involved with the creation of bitcoin, but couldn’t even fake it convincingly? Classic!
Wow, based on your posting history, you actually believe this!
So if we assume the reservist had 'taken a course', why do you think 'taking a course' will prevent negligence/accidents like this? Aren't incidents like these bound to happen, even with a lot of training?

People keep saying 'BUT WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS?!' and I'll be honest with you, I don't really care at this point. Making the plan 'affordable' for people with preexisting conditions only serves to make it so expensive for everyone else that we can't even afford health insurance for our own families anymore. Plus, you know, health insurance and health care aren't the same thing.

The ACA also makes it illegal for insurance companies to drop coverage if you get sick while currently insured. You don't mind this being removed?
I don't doubt it's him. As I said in another post, it's a classic Craig move. First, he has no problem with lying under oath, as he's done it at least twice already. 
Second, this is pure posturing. There’s practically  zero chance that he’ll be deposed or otherwise face legal consequences for this. And even if he did, the onus would be on the authorities to disprove that he’s Satoshi. He wouldn’t be ‘forced to sign’ or anything like that. No prosecutor would care enough to take this case. 
Third, this is part of his strategy of having his footprints everywhere. He’s trying to Gish gallop the subject, and that’s been the strategy from the beginning. That’s how Ian Grigg was bamboozled. He produces prodigious amounts of bullshit and relies on the confusion to convince people. 
If anyone’s been paying attention, he’s been laying the groundwork all along for never ‘signing’ anything. Try reading this with a straight face. 
The data will be practically useless until the volume goes up significantly. Don't draw any conclusions at this point.
That's easy.

Even if the SV consensus rule sets have majority hash

The BTC consensus rules have majority hash, like it or not.

with 1 guy owning bitcoin.com unilaterally deciding which client.... then the bitcoin experiment has failed.

Again, if only hashrate mattered, you'd be ignoring BCH and only have BTC. Obviously, there's something outside of the system that makes you overlook hashrate and pick BCH. Why can't that be the case here as well? Maybe some people think that 128MB blocks are too dangerous right now and don't want to risk their money with that chain. It's up to the people to use whichever chain they want.
You can specially plead that BTC 'isn't bitcoin' because (insert whatever non-hashrate-reason you'd like), but you can't simultaneously claim that hashpower is the only thing that matters. 

SBI, nChain, Coingeek, Squire Mining are different companies

Ah, in the same way that you are different from /u/Geekmonk and all these other users?
/u/3quality

Sounds good, but not before we make fun of him just a little more. 
Uhh, their ‘chief scientist’ being a huge fraud who claimed to be Satoshi? Ring any bells?

.that’s simply being smart if you wish for people to not make connections

If Craig was so concerned about staying anonymous, why did he apply for optional tax credits in 2013 that would practically require that he prove that he's Satoshi to the government?
By the way, in that attempt to get free money from the Australian government, they caught him faking a Bitcoin trust and fined him over $1 million AUD.

What matters is if it's true or not.

It's not. 

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key signing
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)
His own mother admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
He is not technically competent in the subject matter
His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's
He called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space
He actively bought and traded coins from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
He was paid millions for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive


In a law case about billions of dollars you can be assured that the laywers studied their case thoroughly.

No, they could just be aiming for a settlement. They could know that Craig is a fraud, but know he won't admit it in public court (and nChain would not want him to either). The best outcome for both sides would be to settle. That way, Craig wins since everyone will think this is a sign he's actually Satoshi, and the Kleiman brother wins since he will get paid.

CSW is one of the smartest, innovative, and influential individuals in the crypto space

That sentiment is not universal. From Peter Rizun:

CSW has told bald-faced lies in public, and his "technical ability" is an order-of-magnitude below what he portrays. What I struggle with though is whether his involvement is a net benefit or a net hindrance to BCH .... and he pushes many false statements as fact too.

My emphasis.
It's meant to be more specific than sensitive. That is, I tried to reduce false-positives as much as possible. 
It works much better on accounts that post frequently. 
But maybe I’m faking it!

Mined coins between 2008 and 2010 inclusive.

2008?! 
Moronic error. Faketoshi confirmed. 
He’s been free all this time to publish it himself. This is just another one of his infamous Soon™ responses. In 2016, he promised to move coins from an early block ‘in the coming weeks’. It’s been almost three years...
What a lame cop-out. You said: "you think a guy planted documents on a government server to deceive you". Then, when asked for evidence that these documents existed on said 'government server', you said to DYOR. It appears you didn't take your own advice, my moronic friend. 
Well, I have, and Craig's a fraud. The 'abstract' didn't exist in 2001. There are multiple reasons why that's the case.  
How does it feel to be duped this badly? 
Aren't you having it both ways? In what scenario could a person 'legitimately' complain about furlough pay, in your view?
Or is it your opinion that anyone who doesn't, somehow, already have a significant amount of savings is irresponsible? 
Dude, cool it with the Craig apologetics. You know as well as anyone that this is just another Craig fake signing. You can't be that credulous to think otherwise. 
How are you dumping them for SV if you supposedly lost all of them? 

because you called me a liar there.

Yep, and I apologized for it, which is an admission of a mistake. So, again, thank you for bringing this up.

You made that statement at a time when it was clear to everyone with half a brain what the North Coreans were doing.

I'm not sure how many times I have to say it: I'm simply not as interested in the scaling debate as many are.

Unless he is already ceding defeat in his hashwar.

This was my first thought.

Or is he threatening to effectively burn BSV coins if their paired BCH address spends to CDSV?

Ha, oh wow, I hadn't thought of that. Edit: But all you'd have to do is spend on BSV first! (As pointed out here.)
That's why I'm calling on the lead developers of Bitcoin SV to clarify their boss's position.
Actually, I believe the correct notation is this:
P(k^' mod n = m) -> RISK.^Finance.^ByeTroll
Go to redditsearch.io, search for chatspin in 'posts' over all time. Basically every single post is an account that I've listed that happens to post in /r/btc and share your views on bitcoin. How do you explain that? 
Also, how do you explain all the identical deal posts that only you and those accounts have ever shared that (again) share your interest in Bitcoin Cash?
You've been exposed, my friend.

Because Craig has already shown how to mess with the Wayback Machine for fun and trolling.

How does this make any sense?
This feels like a publicity stunt. 
I had to turn my fan off because I can feel that hand-waving all the way from here. 
Stuff like this and this, I imagine. 
Let’s not pretend he’s an amazing fraudster. He’s been very sloppy, and his ‘following’ is much smaller than you make it out. In fact, the vast majority of the crypto community realizes that he’s a lying fraud. That he managed to trick a small handful of people (from a huge potential pool) is not particularly impressive. 

he also put the plan forth years in advance

What plan was that? You mean in 2013 (the year he first got into Bitcoin) when he faked a bitcoin trust to get tax credits from the Australian government? 
Or in 2014 when he faked a supercomputer company to get tax credits from the Australian government? 
Or in 2015 when he faked being Satoshi to get nTrust (purportedly via Calvin Ayre) to buy his ridiculous patents?

backed the plan up with significant money and capital

He has not put up the capital. The rich person he managed to dupe (Ayre) has put up the capital. 

This guy has some serious talent, I wonder what others you could compare him to in history.

He is a mediocre con man. There are (and were) plenty better than him. Just off the top of my head, we have Bernie Madoff, Lance Armstrong, Ferdinand Demara, and Frank Abagnale. The best frauds, of course, aren’t ever caught. Craig was caught almost immediately.  Some of the others I mentioned here went decades before they were caught. 
You should know you're talking to the former /u/geekmonk, a notorious shill and spammer. It's not surprising that he's promoting Craig so intensely. 
Here are some of his biggest hits.

You seem unable to fathom what it'd be like to concern yourself with truth first and foremost.

Ha, that's funny. You're defending a man who claimed to be Satoshi, while faking blog posts, PGP keys, contracts, and more. You seem to be highly concerned with the 'truth'. 
Dude's mad I've been calling out his other ban-skirting accounts. He's been /u/apresents, /u/wobsd, and /u/bitcoincashuser recently. This is his petty revenge against me, it seems. 

If he is sure that Craig is Satoshi from what proof he got 

Gavin no longer appears to be 'sure' about him. In fact, his blog post explicitly states that we should ignore him.

So, either he was or he wasn’t. In either case, we should ignore him. I regret ever getting involved in the “who was Satoshi” game


This is nothing but baseless slandering

I give references for all my claims. Please point to unsupported claims of mine. 

They try to decrease his credibility to prevent him from reaching people and giving them the truth...

Oh boy. 
No, it's showing that your line of argument is absurd and leads to absurd conclusions. If anything, your argument is showing that babies in the womb are no different than cancer cells. 
Haha, it was way more than one guy. Here's a whole thread of morons (save a few).  Someone who's not banned there might want to spread the good news.
Please elaborate, oh knower of truth!
Tough one. It’s probably this. He got caught faking a bitcoin trust to collect free money from the Australian government. This is basically the heart of the con. Everything started from this. 
A close second is the fake PGP keys. It shows the effort he put into the fakery, and is simultaneously a demonstration of how technically inept he is, disqualifying him as Satoshi. 
Neither is Kleiman. 

We do not know how much hash SV or ABC has on the sidelines.

Right, that's why I made the disclaimer twice.
“Your honor, I only threatened to kill the president. That’s very different from actually doing it. Am I free to go?”
Good point about Ryan conflating the split with the new user-attack that Craig wants to implement. More proof of /u/ryancarnated's explicit shift to malevolence.
Also, I'm not sure why Ryan claims that 'even if you just split dust', all your money could end up being stolen. If you split dust and send the ABC output to a new address, then use that UTXO as an input to a new transaction that moves the rest of your money, I don't see how (with the current threat) SV would be able to steal that, since it would be double-spend invalid, not opcode invalid.  
My goodness, on nearly $1000 worth of volume!
Oh wait, it looks like it just reversed itself. Now ABC is worth about 13 times SV. Please update your post.
Dude, it's $10, not $10,000. 
I accept, though. Good luck!
Note to anyone else: I am open to more of these bets!
And you're dishonest! What a fun game we're playing!
Thank you for proving your idiocy. I await your apology. Oh wait, that would mean you have integrity. 

Plagiarism is not a legal term; however, it is often used in lawsuits.

Thank you! Just sent a $5 tip to the address in the article. Enjoy!

Because you are lying? There are hundreds of posts about chatspin

WTF? Even on reddit search there are like 15 results.
I just randomly clicked on one, and guess what?! Here they are commenting on one of your threads and saying they're in Milan, Italy, where you say you're from, and where fivebucks is based! Yet another sockpuppet!
Jesus, dude, it's OBVIOUS.
Edit: Just clicked another one, and guess what? That person just happens to post on /r/btc as well. And posts about the same game as geekmonk!
Wow, you're denying it! Wonderful!
I left the best part out just in case you did. Here you are as geekmonk pushing 'chatspin' (and here as well).
And here you are pushing it again as 3quality, and again. 
Then you goddamn do it again as lalacarmen!
Then again  as policticallyincorrecd!
Chatspin is not a popular site, and it's rarely mentioned on reddit!
You are a lying shill.
Edit: Found another shill account of yours. Pushing chatspin and posting in /r/btc and /r/entrepreneur. Why are the only people posting about chatspin also posting in /r/btc?? What a coincidence.

Because ALL the "evidence" on your little lists is either wrong, irrelevant, simple misunderstandings, a technical controversy, minor errors, or ambiguous

Wow, what a compelling takedown full of specific evidence!

the overwhelming evidence in the other direction

I'm overwhelmed!

Living as Satoshi in hiding while getting filthy rich

Craig was bankrupt when he signed the contract with nTrust in 2015. 

If you answer to that is, "But none of that is true because he's not Satoshi," then you make a circular argument. You fail at provision reasoning. You hsve to evaluate both scenarios all the way to the end. He is. He isn't. See which in total makes more sense, having evaluated both provisionally without bias, without mixing the two possibilities midway through.

Sure, he's either "the main part of Satoshi" who constantly lies, is technically inept, backdates keys, 'pretends' to not understand Bitcoin in 2011, buys a tiny amount of BTC on MtGox in 2013, sues his 'co-creator', and tries to patent the hell out of bitcoin, or he's a fraud who managed to trick a small handful of people.
I'll let you determine which really is the truth. 

You have no evidence of a team

Correct, and there's counterevidence. All of Satoshi's posts have a similar tone and style, and fall under the same timezone distribution, which matches the leaked IP address. Similarly, the code post time distribution indicates a single person and matches the post timezone distribution. 
There is literally no reason to suspect that 'Satoshi' was a team. Occam's razor applies perfectly.
Better headline: not-fully-published Stylometry analysis suggests Gavin Andresen is most likely out of 4 people to be Satoshi.  
Extremely notable limitation as mentioned in the article:

A limitation of the current study is that it could be measuring the style of genre rather than that of authorship. We may need to come up with a way to standardise the datasets to remove any noise that may come from such a systematic bias. One way could be to remove pronouns from the analysis because these could correlate with the style of an academic paper.

If anything, I think this study only proves how useless this method currently is for finding Satoshi. 

Deadalnix never said CSW is a fraud. 

He heavily implied it here. 

Peter slandered Craig accusing him of plagiarism over a missing citation in a draft. 

You mean libel, but it's false either way, since it was absolutely plagiarism. Over half of the paper was straight-up copied. No added citation would fix that issue.
By the way, why did you delete your /u/geekmonk account?

Cool, he adapted a common set of math that is widely repeated by many on gambling math to apply to crypto mining.

No. He copied entire sections nearly verbatim without any attribution. Also, the math doesn't even prove what he was trying to prove. It seems like an attempt at razzle-dazzle.

He also added a citation to a book for his formula.

No, he didn't. The book didn't include these theorems or their proofs. 

If you fall for this vague comparison of a super common concept

Look again. It's blatant plagiarism. The screenshot Peter shared is only a very small part of it.

The paper he copied is relevant.

It's not relevant to his argument. 

So he didn't reword it enough. So what?

So he was just trying to razzle-dazzle people like you and /u/geekmonk into believing his claim. Why would he include the proof instead of just cite it? In fact, he botched some of the plagiarism and made it wrong. It's also important to note that this is, you know, academic fraud. 
Well, since you repeated your question, I'll repeat my answer:

Satoshi likely isn't just one man but a few guys working together. 

Zero evidence for this claim.

And Craig fits as one of the team members, so... 

No he doesn't. His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's, there's no evidence he could code C++ (or at all!) at the time, etc.

Also have you considered he doesn't care to prove it?

Oh how convenient! Note that there's no evidence that he received any threats. In fact, he appears to have made that up as well:
Death threats like he claims in this article? 

It linked to an article headlined ‘UK Law Enforcement Sources Hint at Impending Craig Wright Arrest’. The article suggested that the father of bitcoin might be liable, under the Terrorism Act, for the actions of people who used bitcoin to buy weapons. Under the link, Wright had written an explanation: ‘I walk from 1 billion or I go to jail. I never wanted to be out, but if I prove it, they destroy me and my family. I am the source of terrorist funds as bitcoin creator or I am a fraud to the world. At least a fraud is able to see his family. There is nothing I can do.’

Yeah, that 'article' that Craig is talking about is totally fake too and probably came directly from Craig himself.
Where's Yoda when you need him?
To be fair, the conclusion is "unlikely sockpuppet" based on the post timings. (I wrote this script.)
It's meant to be more specific than sensitive. That is, I tried to reduce false-positives as much as possible. 
This is an incredible straw-man of the issue. Look at the headline of this post. 
First (and most importantly), there's no evidence that these were Satoshi's keys.
Second, all this 'paper' says is that it was possible to configure GPG to produce a key with the metadata shown. However, the argument wasn't that it was literally impossible. The argument was that it was exceedingly unlikely to choose those SPECIFIC 'pref-hash-algos' that just happened to be the default in a later release of the GPG software.
Compelling argument!
Here's some helpful background info about Craig S. Wright for anyone who is unfamiliar. 
The middle class is a family making 6 figures now? I'd call that 'upper middle'. Surely the majority of the middle class makes less than 6 figures, no?
Would you support a much larger tax on the wealthy to offset the increases for the upper middle class?
You wouldn't just blame the democrats for being obstructionists?

then Craig got a hold of Dave's PGP private key after his death?

No, he faked a PGP key for Dave and backdated it to 2007 and uploaded it to the MIT key server. He just forgot to backdate his computer when he faked this email.
I would say you’re playing dumb, but you’re not playing. 
Holy crap that /s was super necessary. 
Not as far as I can tell. He's taken the stance of 'I regret ever getting involved in the “who was Satoshi” game, and am going to spend my time on more fun and productive pursuits'. 
That's fine, but it ignores his role in catapulting Craig into prominence in the first place (and therefore his responsibility in helping to rid itself of Craig). And what a mistake it was!
Gavin went to London already convinced that Craig was Satoshi. This is what got him 'convinced':

But he began to believe in Wright once he started corresponding with him by email in early April. At one point, Wright sent him two emails, one written in his own Craig Wright way, and another one, with essentially the same content, written as Satoshi would have written it. They discussed maths and the history of the invention and the problems it had faced. Within a week, Andresen was sufficiently convinced to get on a plane to London.

Wow, compelling stuff! Keep in mind, it's not like Craig actually had access to the emails between Satoshi and Gavin:

Wright told me that around this time he was in correspondence with Wei Dai, with Gavin Andresen, who would go on to lead the development of bitcoin, and Mike Hearn, a Google engineer who had ideas about the direction bitcoin should take. Yet when I asked for copies of the emails between Satoshi and these men he said they had been wiped when he was running from the ATO.

I think /u/gavinandresen owes the community an apology, or, at the very least, should indicate whether he still holds the opinion that Craig is Satoshi. This half-assed response isn't good enough. In my experience, Gavin's the primary reason most people give when I ask why the mountain of evidence against Craig being Satoshi does not convince them. 

in 2001

Lol. Let me guess: there's zero proof that it was written in 2001. I bet it's Coming Soon™.
Does anyone still believe this shit?
It’s like asking ‘what would you do if flat earthers are right?’ There’s simply no chance. 
So in that spirit, to answer your question, I’d be too concerned with other things (like my sanity) to give any thought to Bitcoin’s future. 
Why did you insist on double-salary? What about a single parent, or even a single non-parent with significant debt (student or health)? A salaried federal employee could make less than $23,000 per year, which is about $440 per week. 
Even assuming they paid cash to rig online polls (which I tend to doubt), are 'correct the record' or 'shareblue' the sitting President, though?
Greg Maxwell did just that for the genesis block. 

His 13 examples on page 6 and 7 of his paper look very similar to the examples on page 222 - 223 of Kleene's Introduction to Meta-mathematics

They look similar, but they are verbatim from the planetmath site, which includes a lot of additional information. He clearly plagiarised it directly from planetmath.
I see the reference, and have a digital copy of the book right now, but I cannot see where any of the text in Craig's paper came from. Do you have a page number?
Edit: mohrt is full of shit. Craig copies directly from planetmath. 

btw how was 40% calculated?

I counted the number of pages the plagiarized text took up and divided it by the total number of pages. 
There are at least two uncited sources. I’m not accusing him of copyright infringement (though he may be guilty of that). I’m accusing him of lack of integrity and academic fraud. 

Only that source says that. The other one does not.
That only applies for copyright (ie - legal) purposes. This is about integrity and academic fraud. 


Craig Wright is Satoshi, and has been proven correct again and again, and this is why he is attacked.

Yeah, I think you've been misinformed.

Lol, just ignoring the part where they're commenting in one of your 'deal' threads as well, that's completely unrelated to chatspin. 
Thanks. Even further proof, then!
"Declaring it to the Statists" had nothing to do with paying taxes. He 'declared' it only for the purposes of trying to extract money from the government for an optional tax CREDIT. This is utter nonsense.  

If I was about to be outted for the single greatest invention of the 21st century...

You gave away the game in the very first sentence. Nobody suspected Craig was Satoshi in 2013, when he started applying for optional tax credits from the Australian government, which required him to claim he owned over a million BTC. If he was so terrified of being outed, WHY WOULD HE VOLUNTARILY OUT HIMSELF TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALL PLACES?
Some of that evidence. 
...incomplete PHP code, and it was published after Satoshi's C++ code.
Nothing says ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ like ‘patented authority-based’. 

A limitation of the current study is that it could be measuring the style of genre rather than that of authorship. We may need to come up with a way to standardise the datasets to remove any noise that may come from such a systematic bias. One way could be to remove pronouns from the analysis because these could correlate with the style of an academic paper.

Another limitation is that this analysis was done with four candidates. 
Yeah, /u/vbuterin has a good track record on calling out bad actors who should be shunned.
Wow, you're doubly-wrong! Nice job! From Emin's paper:

The protocol will adapt the mining difficulty such that the mining rate at the
main chain becomes one block per 10 minutes on average. Therefore, the actual
revenue rate of each agent is the revenue rate ratio; that is, the ratio of its
blocks out of the blocks in the main chain. 

TL;DR: /u/ch00f thinks video is not too long.

maybe you're projecting? 

Provide some evidence like I did. I'm not asking people to blindly believe me.
Thanks! It'll be rapidly downvoted though (and now we know why!).
From here: http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-arent-skewed-trump-really-is-losing-badly/:
If any of this sounds familiar — and if I sound a little exasperated — it’s probably because we went through this four years ago. Remember UnSkewedPolls.com? (The website is defunct, but you can view an archived picture of it here.) The main contention of that site and others like it was that the polls had too many Democratic respondents in their samples. Dean Chambers, who ran the site, regularly wrote that the polls were vastly undercounting independents and should have used a higher proportion of Republicans in their samples. But in the end, the polls underestimated President Obama’s margin.
Bitcoins explained like you're five.
Few things are provable beyond all doubt. Someone moving Satoshi's coins may have stolen them, found a weakness in ECDSA, or even just guessed the private key (astonishingly unlikely but still literally possible). 
The number of future-matching settings in the PGP key (not just pref-hash-algos) comes close to these astronomical unlikelihoods.

but asking someone else to do the dirty business that is in your interest

It's not really in my interest personally, other than the satisfaction I'd get seeing Craig face the consequences. 
It was Roger's choice to become a public figure. He uses it to his advantage frequently. I'm asking him to use it to everyone's advantage.
He definitely lied under oath at least twice. 
Looks like I was right. Thanks!
By the way, do you actually believe that excuse? I'm continually surprised by people's ability to self-deceive.
Of course, it doesn't address /u/jstolfi's argument that the abstract is nonsense with Craig's backdated plagiarism. But I'm sure that doesn't bother you. Craig could say anything and you'd be satisfied. 
Wow, zero? Is that hyperbole? So, if it turns out to be totally true, it would presumably shock you more than aliens making contact with us tomorrow? 
I think you're right. Look at this bullshit he's peddling. 

Also found out that CSW at one time owned the world's most powerful privately-owned supercomputer.

Utterly false. It was just another attempt to squeeze out free money from the Australian government. 
/u/Anenome5 is peddling horseshit.

SV chain PoW hash will inevitably catch up and pass that of ABC chain. 

Would something magical happen at that point? I don't remember seeing the code in the ABC client that switches to a completely different chain with different validity rules if it's longer. Can you point it out?

(8 months ago), a few people - like Rick Falkvinge and myself

8 months? Newb.
;)
Simplest explanation: he got conned by a conman. It happens even to smart people. 
I see the reference, and have a digital copy of the book right now, but I cannot see where any of the text in Craig's paper came from. Do you have a page number?
Getting lectured by /u/cryptorebel about trying to spin things... will wonders never cease.
Yeah, this is a totally fair comparison, because we are all shunning Craig for his heretical technical viewpoints and not at all because he's a glaringly obvious fraud.  
Very interesting, thanks! 
It's pretty clear that Craig just saw someone tweet something about it and almost immediately jumped on it as some kind of take-down rebuttal to Emin's point. Compare the timestamps of the tweets. (Craig's came one minute after this 'evidence' was first brought to light.)

Someone at flickr (probably this @Kellan Elliott-McCrea) must have been into bitcoin quite early.

I actually wouldn't be completely shocked if it were just independently invented, either. 
Do you think Craig was 'the main part of Satoshi' or not? It's a very simple question. Yes or no?

So maybe a fraud, scammer, faking signatures and lying. Whatever.

Whatever? Wow. 

But saying he was not involved in creating bitcoin, giving his academic background and experience in the gambling industry is not realistic.

Sorry, his academic background is not in the relevant fields, gambling has little to do with bitcoin besides some never-implemented sample code, and there are literally thousands of people with backgrounds more suited to being Satoshi than Craig. 

he’s just not good at communicating or debating ideas.

Or telling the truth. 
That thread was nicely debunked here.
Give one example of how my evidence is bad. 
The fraud even admitted it five months ago. As far as I can tell, the current Craig apologist line is that he faked it ‘on purpose’ to cast doubt on him being Satoshi. Despite the fact that he’s the one who originated the claim. 
No one claimed that his believers are bright. 
Pretty weak, but at least you tried. He appears to be very busy posting while I'm clearly asleep. 
I'm willing to dox myself to /u/todu if necessary, though, since /u/nullc is well-known. 
Nah, this is almost certainly /u/wobsd, aka /u/bitcoincashuser, aka /u/apresents. 
williaminlondon aka btcnewsupdates is a horse of a different color.
Give me a break... there are plenty of things he could do that would convince the public that he's Satoshi but leave plenty of room for plausible deniability for tax purposes. He could (anonymously) publish a message like "Crag Wright has a lot of good things to say" and sign it with the genesis key. 
And don't forget the mountain of evidence that points to him not being Satoshi. 

Do transactions using segwit really take $5-$10 and take 8 hours for one confirmation?

No. Right now, it looks like it would be about $2 or a little less to get in the next block. It might take around 8 hours with a fee around $0.35, depending on the exact transaction size.
And this is a relatively high fee period. 
Craig's reply:
It's not literally impossible that someone could have independently come up with the exact same font and called it the same thing! They're all liars! This isn't proof!
Edit: Actually, that's far too concise for Craig. He'd publish a rambling 60 page 'paper', then add it to his academic Gish Gallop.
I think caffeine is more associated with simple ‘palpitations’ like premature ventricular contractions and premature atrial contractions rather than a-fib. Though I think I remember a recent study that said it’s not even associated with palpitations. 
Who is claiming that she's the rightful winner? It seems like most people just think this is an unfair system. Something like 70% of the population disagrees with the electoral college. Also, it goes against the idea that Trump has a 'mandate' or that he won in anything like a landslide. 
Not really. Over 25% of young muslims believe that suicide bombing is justified. Poll

Do you have the full transcription by any chance? I am curious if the signature actually validates with the key in question.

I only have the scanned image. Unfortunately, the font makes uppercase I and lowercase L indistinguishable. I think there are 12 instances of that (but none in the first 32 bytes). I haven't tried all 2^12 combinations, but maybe I'll write a script, or someone else can. 

Also, I really hope that Dave Kleiman Estate's lawyers are aware of this. Has anyone contacted them?

One of the lawyers 'liked' a reference to it on Twitter, so I think so.
This is true. I've been meaning to install it. Here is the link to the main motion. The email is described as Exhibit A.
People like /u/SharkLaserrrrr always take the cop-out way. They support Craig and think he's Satoshi, but when push comes to shove, they a) say it's irrelevant whether or not he's Satoshi, or b) say they're not 'fully convinced' he's Satoshi and act like we're the extremists because we are fully convinced that he's a fraud. That allows them to look past any and all evidence. 
This has the most thorough treatment of Satoshi’s abstract changes. 
Geekmonk! I see you’re resurrecting all of your sockpuppets. 
For anyone wondering, "grown ups" is what /u/btcnewsupdates calls the voices in his head. 

B4 trolls start lying, my Reddit was banned bc apparently I ban evaded /r/freelance. 

Dude was such a giant shill that he got banned from a freelance subreddit. Think about that. That's next-level shill. 
That’s outrageous! It’s over 1000x what I would pay for BSV.  
Practically every word in this title is wrong. But as to the 'meat' of the claim:

The material in question was cited by Wright with Kleene's Intro to Metamathematics, 1952 (p. 222-223).

That's just not true at all. 
Feel free to compare the (poorly) referenced source with Craig's paper and the planetmath source. 
It's undeniable that Craig copied directly from planetmath. Note the changed notation, different list of functions, different annotations, etc. 
This should be the example on Wikipedia for "Poe's law".
Without a lame cop out, do you, personally, think that Craig Wright is or was ‘the main part’ of Satoshi?
This question is relevant because your software claims to implement Satoshi’s vision. You can’t fall back on it being based only on the historical Satoshi because:

The ‘reenabled’ opcodes are different from Satoshi’s
Satoshi clearly didn’t want to ‘freeze the protocol’ since he included code for multi-byte opcodes. 

If you don’t think he’s Satoshi, why would you work for such a fraud?

Any random white person in America would get the same result.

I don't think this is true:

To determine whether the
Native American ancestry results in the sample were unusually high relative to other individuals of
European ancestry, analysis was also performed on 185 individuals from two reference sets from the
1000 Genomes Project— Americans of predominantly European ancestry from Utah (n = 99 individuals)
and British individuals of European ancestry from Great Britain (n = 86 individuals). 

...

The sample was compared to the results of the 185 reference individuals with European ancestry,
from Great Britain and Utah.
• The segment on chromosome 10 observed in the individual is larger than any of the segments
identified as having Native American ancestry in any of the 185 reference individuals.
• The total length of Native American segments observed in the individual is greater than the
average value for the reference individuals — by 12.4-fold (corresponding to 12.7 standard deviations)
for the individuals from Great Britain and 10.5-fold (corresponding to 4.9 standard deviations) for the
individuals from Utah.

Do you still feel that way?
Here you go?
nChain isn't legally bound to pay any bounties, since it's vague and unenforceable at the moment. However, the wording of their 'offer' makes it seem like they're interested in keeping BCH secure as opposed to simply 'protecting' their own implementation:

In order to demonstrate its commitment to rewarding responsible bug disclosures, the Bitcoin SV team will begin by offering the highest tier reward of USD $100,000 (sponsored by CoinGeek and of course, payable in BCH) to Cory Fields, a security researcher who found and responsibly disclosed a potential BCH chain-splitting bug in May of this year. The result of this anonymous disclosure was a rapid and professional response that ensured the vulnerability was patched quickly and the network secured. Through its bug bounty program, the Bitcoin SV project wants to encourage more professional disclosures like that to help strengthen BCH.

The fact that they paid one of these bounties to an ABC-specific bug reinforces that notion. 
So what's 'going on' is that the community is pointing out that the 'bounty offer' seems to be much more of a PR move than an actual commitment to 'strengthen BCH'.
Paging /u/heuristicpunch (or any of your shill accounts).
Edit: 5% upvoted after 2 minutes with 6 views! Did you downvote this with all of your accounts?
Found it. Also, redditsearch.io seems to have it archived, even though it was deleted. See the fourth result. 

You do remember that it wasn't until 2016 when CSW started being demonized?

LOL, he was being demonized far earlier than 2016, even for things unrelated to Bitcoin. 

Anyone who's done ANY coding at all knows that 'Hello World' is generic - there is really only one proper way to write it in any language

My goodness you're an idiot.

The first available code?

As far as I can tell, it's the first C++ code implementing it, and he goes into significant detail justifying his reasons for using it. 

Or was it just calling a library?

No, it's all self-contained.

Could Satoshi be multiple people?

No evidence for that, and evidence against it.

So that any individual isn't necessarily aware of every line of code/whitepaper?

This is basic stuff.

I'm trying to get people off the speculation track by showing how hard and pointless this guessing game is. Don't spend too much time on it.

Good thing we don't need to speculate. We know beyond a reasonable doubt that Craig is a fraud and technically incompetent.
Let's keep in mind this is a person who fraudulently claimed to be Satoshi, and used his dead 'friend' as cover for the story. 

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked bitcoin trusts
He called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space, and his grammar is abysmal, whereas Satoshi's was excellent.
He actively bought and traded a grand total of 50(!) coins from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014, when he claimed to own hundreds of thousands.
He was fined over a million dollars by the Australian Tax Office for fraudulently claiming tax credits based on a bitcoin trust that didn't exist. Some excerpts:


On 11 August 2014, during an interview with Counsel engaged by the ATO, your Director and controlling mind, Craig Wright, has admitted that he backdated these invoices
Craig Wright purports to have received a loan of 650,000 Bitcoin from the Seychelles Trust pursuant to a Deed of Loan entered into with the Trustee for the Seychelles Trust; a company called Design by Human Ltd (DBH). However, records show Craig Wright was only informed of the existence of this company on a date after the purported Deed of Loan was entered into
information obtained from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) confirms that your Director, Craig Wright, only obtained control of DBH in January 2014 (after the ATO issued its private ruling) and had no prior involvement with the company. It also suggests he backdated the Directorship of Uyen Nguyen and Dave Kleiman
Additionally, you have not demonstrated an ability to earn income other than claiming ATO refunds, you have not traded with any third parties or employed any staff. As set out in our decision relating to the shortfall, your intended business activities could not turn a profit and there has not been any real or lasting contribution to your share capital by your purported shareholders. There is therefore, no evidence that you were conducting an enterprise during the period for which the statement was made.

He is a complete and utter fraud, and nearly everyone knows it. 
For what it’s worth, this is what Satoshi said about it:

I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.  So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.

Edit: A completely on-topic and in-context quote from Satoshi is downvoted? 
A fraud. 

Also, patents are not for blocking, they are for being able to get paid for their use. Or giving it for free if they want.

Have you honestly never heard of patent trolls?
I don't know why you're not getting this. 'The math' is not proving what you think it's trying to prove. Again, I await your third 'mea culpa' about this. Are you sensing a pattern here?

Change the proof-of-work? Not Bitcoin. 

Satoshi doesn't agree:

If we see a weakness in SHA256 coming gradually, we can transition to a new hash function after a certain block number.  Everyone would have to upgrade their software by that block number.  The new software would keep a new hash of all the old blocks to make sure they're not replaced with another block with the same old hash.

Yes, this is if SHA-256 is broken or nearing its end of life, but it's still changing it, and it'd still be Bitcoin. 
Sounds good to me. I'm only here to convince the (many) true believers that Craig isn't Satoshi, and to take his future assertions with more skepticism than normal. 
Green is amazing! Our eyes literally evolved to be most sensitive to the color green. Image sensors take advantage of that fact to maximize the apparent resolution. 
It's easily better than red, the color of death, anger, and blood.
This seems to be the heart of the post:

Our ASIC chips, like those of some other manufacturers, have a circuit design that supports ASICBOOST. However, the ASICBOOST method has not been used by us on the mainnet. We have not seen any evidence yet on the main net that anyone has used it in the patented way.
Bitmain holds the ASICBOOST patent in China. We can legally use it in our own mining farms in China to profit from it and sell the cloud mining contracts to the public. This, however profitable, is not something we would do for the greater good of Bitcoin.
The mining equipment produced by Bitmain for its own use is in no way intended to be technically superior or more power-efficient than the equipment it sells to the public. The ASICBOOST method has not been employed by Bitmain to increase the power-efficiency of the miners in its own mining farms.

There have been two 4-block reorgs in BTC’s history, I think. They were a long time ago.
That’s exactly what Craig did. The key on the MIT key server is absolutely fake. It was not created in 2007.

If a signed message is all it takes to prove CSW is a perjurer

Well, it's already quite apparent that he's a perjurer. 

couldn't you reach out to Jed McCaleb as well

Sure.
Maybe this is a good opportunity to link to a previous ATO investigation into Craig’s business dealings where they caught him faking a bitcoin trust and fined him over a million dollars. 
Case in point. 
Kleiman posted on the same message board as Satoshi, but on totally different topics. He's never even mentioned Bitcoin or digital currency. 
The only reason he's discussed at all is because Faketoshi dragged his dead 'friend' into his con. 
I think you meant to reply to a different comment, but can you point out a single thing that's been 'debunked'?
Worry not! He'll be back. In the meantime, enjoy this nugget:
In one of his last Twitter posts, Craig said:
"I am a lawyer and this [financial law] is my area of speciality."
Compare that to the real Satoshi, when Mike Hearn asked him about how a financial law applied to Bitcoin:
"I am not a lawyer and I can't possibly answer that."
QED.
(Note: Craig's claim to be a lawyer stems from the fact that he got a 1-year degree from a correspondence course in 2008.)

Yes. 30% approval from Democrats is significantly higher than I'd expect and 82% from independents is huge!

Are you sure it's 'huge', since those numbers are likely highly selected as well? 
That is, it's not that 30% of all democrats would have approved; it was 30% of those democrats who chose to watch (who likely are more 'right-aligned' than the 'typical' democrat). The same analysis goes for independents, if not moreso. 
Exactly the question I had. I feel like this might open up a new attack vector where the attacker can purposely mine two new separate chaintips and release them to different pools.

No, my point is always your hypocrisy (supporting the North Corean fraud and on the other hand obsessively accusing another Person of fraud).

And it's a ridiculous, illogical point. 
My evidence that Craig is a fraud stands on its own. I've never asked anyone to trust me. And others, whom you'd no doubt consider more 'pure' than I, also have pointed out his obvious fraudulence. So, if you don't think I'm qualified (or whatever you're suggesting) to point out Craig's fraudulence, just listen to someone else who's saying essentially the same thing, like /u/Zectro. Or /u/DrBaggypants, who worked with Craig. 
Do you ever stop whining about yourself? 
How embarrassing for Jon Matonis. 
What about great acts of fraud?
Yes, and none of those have the text in question. 
It’s lazier!

nchain is against it and Coingeek is against it

Why are you counting these separately? Coingeek is just nChain's mouthpiece.
Speaking of promises, does anyone remember when Craig said he was going to provide ‘extraordinary proof’ that he is Satoshi?
Maybe he meant he was promising up to extraordinary proof. 
You said almost the exact same thing three weeks ago. I guess you just ignored my reply. 
And even if most of my activity is weeding out bad actors: so what? That's a valuable service to a community. 
Hilarious. This might be the best part:

Two years ago, I wrote a blog piece that remains cogent and has hardly been read correctly. 

First, he says his infamous fake signing 'Sartre' blog post was not 'read correctly'. He was, his story goes, using it to refuse to sign (despite completely faking a real Satoshi signature). However, the moron seemingly forgot that the very next day, he posted this:

I can prove access to the early keys and I can and will do so by moving bitcoin ...
So, over the coming days, I will be posting a series of pieces that will lay the foundations for this extraordinary claim, posting independently-verifiable documents and evidence addressing some of the false allegations that have been levelled, and transferring Bitcoin from an early block. ...
I will present what I believe to be “extraordinary proof” and ask only that it be independently validated.

Actually, the next few sentences may even be better:

In my past, I taught the ability to use robot.txt files in a manner that would create varying information within sources such as the wayback machine. The wayback machine is not a terribly good archive site for forensic purposes. One skilled in the art can select files that appear and disappear over time. Two files can be simultaneously loaded and based on a subsequent robot.txt file one can choose which one will appear at any time

He's implicitly defending his fake blog posts as genuine! This is amazing. It's fine if he wants to pretend that he made it at the time, then deleted it before it was archived, then undeleted it for some reason, let it be archived, then deleted it yet again. However, one remaining problem is that one fake post calls Bitcoin a 'cryptocurrency' in August of 2008. That fully contradicts the evidence of when that word was first used from Satoshi's own description!:

While Satoshi never discussed anything personal in these e-mails, he would banter with Martti about little things. In one e-mail, Satoshi pointed to a recent exchange on the Bitcoin e-mail list in which a user referred to Bitcoin as a “cryptocurrency,” referring to the cryptographic functions that made it run. 
“Maybe it’s a word we should use when describing Bitcoin. Do you like it?” Satoshi asked.
“It sounds good,” Martti replied. “A peer to peer cryptocurrency could be the slogan.”

From: Nathaniel Popper. “Digital Gold.” (That email exchange would have been around mid-2009, almost a year after Craig's totally real blog post.)
But that's not all! Beyond the idiocy of taking meticulous steps to hide your identity then just publicly posting about it on your blog, there's even more stupidity on display.
Here is the text of one of his fake posts:

"Well.. e-gold is down the toilet. Good idea, but again centralised authority. The Beta of Bitcoin is live tomorrow. This is decentralized... We try until it works. Some good coders on this. The paper rocks"

Here is the fake blog post . Look at the timestamp of the post: it's January 10, 2008 at 4:30pm local time (AEST). The post says that Bitcoin is 'going live tomorrow'. However, it had already gone live by the time this blog post went up! It had been live for over 4 hours. In literally no sense would 'tomorrow' be correct.
Someone actually pointed this out to Craig on Twitter, but in his usual way, he tersely replied with complete nonsense. 
Again, I ask, how does anyone think this guy is Satoshi?
CC: current chief Craig apologist /u/ratifythis
Yes, it’s a nice story for those who’d like to cling to some belief that Craig had a hand in Bitcoin’s inception. However, it’s not true, and Craig was not involved in Bitcoin’s inception. 
I think the issue is that people find the idea that Craig may simply be exaggerating his involvement as an attractive middle-ground. They think: "ah, Craig actually was involved, but he just lied about being the 'main part'." 

There is also very little doubt that he was involved in bitcoin development from the beginning.

Ha, sure. His first real exposure to Bitcoin was when he started trading small amounts on MtGox in early 2013. He quickly launched a scheme to pretend to have a bitcoin trust to claim tax credits from the Australian government. They caught him and fined him over a million dollars. 
Let's not pretend these technical errors are of the same magnitude...

not going to bother checking since its a distraction from the topic of the OP)

I don’t mind if you don’t bother, since the last time I showed you an undeniable Craig fraud, you looked the other way. Seriously, anyone who wants to see how you evaluate evidence, read that thread. 

The source is reliable.

Did this source happen to backdate PGP keys, fake bitcoin trusts, and fake blog posts to make it look like he was involved in Bitcoin’s creation?
You obviously didn't even read the link I gave. It shows that the very method in the paper you just linked proves that they are backdated. By updating the keys the way that paper shows, it changes the internal timestamps, but Craig's keys don't have their timestamps changed.
Anything else?

I don't trust people who are buddies with obvious trolls like Emin

But you do apparently trust people who fake blog posts and PGP keys to claim that they are Satoshi? 
Also, why are you lecturing on trust, when you are an admitted vote manipulator?
I think the funniest / scariest part is when Craig claims that the companies nChain invested in will do whatever Craig wants. 
People who think that nChain is a neutral actor in this space (and prefer to 'wait and see') are incredibly naive. 

It does not seem to be disputed that he was one of the first small scale miners

Evidence? 
Bullshit. 

(Interviewer:) ‘So what happened on Monday,’ I asked, ‘when it came to writing that blog?’
(Craig:) ‘I gave them the wrong thing,’ he said. ‘Then they changed it. Then I didn’t correct it because I was so angry. Which was stupid. I put up the wrong one.


Some people who are 100% convinced that CSW is Satoshi would argue that he provided the fake proof publicly so that it would get debunked and people would leave him alone.

The logic behind this line of thought is incredible, nonsensical, and against the evidence. 

We spoke about Wright’s possible lies. I said that all through these proof sessions, he’d acted this like this was the last thing he ever wanted.
‘That’s not true,’ MacGregor said. ‘He freaking loves it. Why was I so certain he’d do that BBC interview the next day? It’s adoration. He wants this more than we want this, but he wants to come out of this looking like he got dragged into it.’ He told me if everything had gone to plan, the groundwork was laid for selling the patents. It was a really big deal. He said Ramona had said that if Wright doesn’t come out you still have this really smart guy who has made all these patents, who knows all about bitcoin. ‘Yeah,’ MacGregor said. ‘You and five hundred other guys who have called today.’ I shook their hands and wished them luck, thinking I would probably never see the men in black again. And as I descended in the lift, I thought I would miss their brio and their belief, despite everything.

It also basically leaves no reason to think he's actually Satoshi. Which is more likely:

He's a fraud
He's a fraud, but is actually Satoshi and just pretending to be a fraud

This is about the most straightforward application of Occam's razor ever. 
Paging /u/Craig_s_wright and /u/peter__r

The only thing that keeps your funds secure in a Lightning Network is the presumption that there is an honest, always-on monitor that can always alert you to a fraudulent close of your channel - essentially the same as being able to detect a double-spend in the mempool.

This is misleading. They are not the same. There is no significant financial motive for a user to not double-spend. However, there is an actual penalty for attempting to fraudulently close a channel. 

TLDR if you presume the existence of a monitor, as Lightning requires, then it turns out you don't need Lightning in the first place to do instant P2P payments.

This is also wrong. There is nothing preventing a miner from publishing the second transaction of a double-spend. They are not penalized at all and neither is the user. The security models are different.

doesn't have time to read my articles and give technical feedback

Started it off with a lie. Impressive!

claiming it is not worth his time

I've told you about 4 times now, I just wasn't interested. 

Claims to be a moderately wealthy business owner

Not really an extraordinary claim, but I'll provide proof to this sub's mod /u/todu if you really insist!

sometimes toddlers

Haha, hoisted by your own petard.
Oh come off it. The reluctant Satoshi story is utter bullshit. 

We spoke about Wright’s possible lies. I said that all through these proof sessions, he’d acted this like this was the last thing he ever wanted.
‘That’s not true,’ MacGregor said. ‘He freaking loves it. Why was I so certain he’d do that BBC interview the next day? It’s adoration. He wants this more than we want this, but he wants to come out of this looking like he got dragged into it.’ He told me if everything had gone to plan, the groundwork was laid for selling the patents

Again, most importantly, there's no evidence these are Satoshi's keys!

They are listed in 4880, that came out in 2007. So, wrong.

What am I wrong about? Are you claiming that it wasn't unlikely that you'd pick those specific pref-hash-algos?

And you missed how pref can be changed at ANY point

Can you read? Where did I deny this?
It's never nice to watch a conman succeed.
I thought /u/jstolfi had an interesting take on it here.

It is like trying to resolve a dispute between Alice who want to travel by train and Bob who wants to go by plane, by fitting train wheels to a Boeing plane and having it travel on train tracks.
SegWit2X will increase the block size limit, so it is totally unacceptable to Blockstream and their vassals. It will keep the network congested, so it will be totally unacceptable to the big-blockers. What is the point?

Lol. Evidence?
If I said your writing style sounds like a three-year-old's, I'm not actually asserting that you're three.
How did I slander you? 
Dude, take it easy. You sound like you're in a religious fervor. 
I think the root issue is that you're operating under the assumption that gay marriage advocates are insisting that all religions should be compelled to perform gay marriages. This is not the case in the US, UK, or anywhere else I know of. 
Assuming that this is not the case, do you still have an argument? 
24% is your marginal rate. To get your effective rate, divide how much you paid in taxes (probably around $5.5k for you) into your salary -- this comes out to around 12%, which is the number you'd compare to Romney's.
I was banned for accusing someone of being a reddit-rule-evading sock puppet. 
The redditor in question then had his account suspended for being a rule-evading sock puppet.
It's Exhibit A of this motion.
At this point, here's what it would take for me to believe Craig was Satoshi:
Show that the genesis coinbase address isn't a real address, and instead it's an OP_HASH160 of a message saying:
"I'm actually Craig S. Wright, and I'm going to pretend to be a moronic tax fraud and general idiot for the next 10 years. I'm also going to purposely fabricate evidence to make it look like I'm Satoshi so that people DON'T think I'm Satoshi. Get it? Oh, and I'll also pretend to not be able to code. At all."
He pretended that there were threats against him.
Thank you for illustrating my point so succinctly, person who uses Gavin to support why they think Craig is Satoshi.
You joke, but there are those who would absolutely say that with a straight face. 

i see you're not familiar with the concept of 'reality', huh?

Says the person who apparently thinks Craig Wright is Satoshi. My sides!
Unless someone figures it out and posts before I do, I’ll have an interesting post about this situation tomorrow morning. 
Exactly.

We've been over this, dude. One of them is likely a deliberately altered and seeded document.

Uhhh, I’m not sure how familiar you are with legal procedures, but these affidavits would have been filed in court and be easily obtainable by Kleiman’s lawyers directly from the court. 
I see I’m not dealing with the most brilliant mind. Sorry, Zangelbert, I think you have to go back to the apologetics drawing board. 
Just out of curiosity, why did you abandon the /u/ForkiusMaximus handle in favor of this one?
We don’t need to. He’s already lied under oath at least twice. 
Here's one time where he swore under oath that he controlled bitcoin addresses he absolutely didn't.
Here's another one where he swore to be a 50% shareholder in Dave Kleimain's company, and the new affidavit where he swore to never have had any ownership interest.
From the first:

The shareholding of W&K Info Defense was:


Craig S. Wright 50.0 %


David A. Kleiman 50.0 %



From the second:

I have never been a director, member, shareholder, officer, employee, or representative of W&K or of any Florida business.

This is a decent summary of his bitcoin-related 'involvement', which began in 2013 when he started trading on MtGox. Shortly after, he started a tax fraud scheme, which snowballed and eventually resulted in his initial claims of being Satoshi. The tax fraud scheme failed when the ATO caught him and fined him over a million dollars. 
Or ... don't fall for the FUD and just carry on. 
That has no bearing on the issue. Besides, it’s only one of the two instances I’ve pointed out. 
I'm still waiting for a page number, because I don't see any of Craig's text in the given reference.
Ha, that's why I wrote at least :)

I can't understand, why he thinks the greek letter phi ϕ is a good way to write 0. It's only in this section, in the remainder of the paper he wrote 0.

Good question.
Thank you for proving your idiocy. I await your apology. Oh wait, that would mean you have integrity. 

Plagiarism is not a legal term; however, it is often used in lawsuits.


There's a good correleation between script length and required cpu cycles 

Citation needed, because I think you're wrong.
Hoo boy, you wrote this article, which is fine, but you also wrote this tripe:

I’ll say first that the accusations of fraud against Dr. Craig Wright are, well, totally fraudulent.
I’ve looked into this extensively and have found no evidence at all to suggest that he did anything wrong other than refuse to provide 100% proof to the public that he is Satoshi after being put between a rock and a hard place the likes of which most people will never come close to experiencing.

Good lord, this is laughably false. The 'being put between a rock and a hard place' was 100% his doing.
If the accusations of fraud against Dr. Craig Wright are 'totally fraudulent', you should have no trouble rebutting these:

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key signing
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)
He faked a bitcoin trust to get free money from the Australian government but was caught and fined over a million dollars. 

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
He is not technically competent in the subject matter
His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's
He called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space
He actively bought and traded coins from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
He was paid millions for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive

Only a sub's mods can report a ban evasion. /u/bitcoinXio , how about it?
I'm not up to speed with contemporary anarchist theory, but isn't it weird that an anarchist wants to use the mechanisms of the state to compel a private company to pay money to him?
I'm not discrediting him; if anything, he's discredited himself. However, even smart people can get bamboozled. 

To my knowledge CSW doesn't purport to be. In fact he has alluded to "far better coders than I ever was.

Well, technically, every coder is far better than he ever was, since he was never a coder.

For all those to be true would point to multiple people being "Satoshi".

A far better explanation is that Gavin was bamboozled by a fraud.

Obviously he was using it as a cheeky joke to say "screw you"

LOL, no. He subsequently posted two other ‘papers’ that equally don’t show that he knows how to code. 

That is a complete straw man setup. Besides all most coders do is copy paste anyways

The irony!

csw has even admitted he is not a great front end coder,

This comment just gets better and better!

he is "better at library code" and things he has said, which is basically copy pasting code, like most devs do.

My sides!
LOL, not one aspect turned out to be true? Let's see you rebut these, you fraud:

You faked blog posts
You faked PGP keys
You faked contracts and emails
You faked bitcoin trusts
You called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space, and your grammar is abysmal, whereas Satoshi's was excellent.
You actively bought and traded a grand total of 50(!) coins from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014, when you claim to have owned hundreds of thousands.
You were fined over a million dollars by the Australian Tax Office for fraudulently claiming tax credits based on a bitcoin trust that didn't exist. Some excerpts:


On 11 August 2014, during an interview with Counsel engaged by the ATO, your Director and controlling mind, Craig Wright, has admitted that he backdated these invoices
Craig Wright purports to have received a loan of 650,000 Bitcoin from the Seychelles Trust pursuant to a Deed of Loan entered into with the Trustee for the Seychelles Trust; a company called Design by Human Ltd (DBH). However, records show Craig Wright was only informed of the existence of this company on a date after the purported Deed of Loan was entered into
information obtained from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) confirms that your Director, Craig Wright, only obtained control of DBH in January 2014 (after the ATO issued its private ruling) and had no prior involvement with the company. It also suggests he backdated the Directorship of Uyen Nguyen and Dave Kleiman
Additionally, you have not demonstrated an ability to earn income other than claiming ATO refunds, you have not traded with any third parties or employed any staff. As set out in our decision relating to the shortfall, your intended business activities could not turn a profit and there has not been any real or lasting contribution to your share capital by your purported shareholders. There is therefore, no evidence that you were conducting an enterprise during the period for which the statement was made.

You are a complete and utter fraud, and nearly everyone knows it. 

Sorry, your wanting me to do something is not the same as my choosing to.

We don't need you to prove anything, not that you could. LOL.
We have all the evidence we need to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that you are a fraud. 

You faked blog posts
You faked PGP keys
You faked contracts and emails
You faked bitcoin trusts.
You called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space, and your grammar is abysmal, whereas Satoshi's was excellent.

Contrarian is a Bitcoin Unlimited troll, probably Peter himself.

It's the really long con! I've had my account for over 7 years and have been posting about bitcoin for over 4 years. I also, apparently, argue with myself about SegWit occasionally. 

I also invited Contrarian for a youtube interview to expose his lies face to face, but he refused to protect his "identity"

I really don't understand this tripe. First, and most importantly, how would a live interview assure that someone is not a shill? Second, there is absolutely nothing to be gained for me for giving up my anonymity. 
Why can't you 'expose my lies' right here and now? Is it because I keep proving you wrong time after time?
Edit to address the edited-in lie: 

Contrarian and his buddies managed to get my other account shadowbanned. 

I had nothing to do with your shadowbanning. In fact, I had no idea you were shadowbanned, and kept asking you why you deleted your account. I mean, I can see why you'd be shadowbanned, since you are a shill and spammer, but I had nothing to do with it.
More heavily upvoted Craig Wright content? Looks like I need to remind people again:
Craig Wright is a serial fabricator and liar. Here's just some of the evidence:

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key signing
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)
His own mother admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

He has provided no independently verifiable evidence, and has given unbelievable excuses when asked
He is not technically competent in the subject matter, nor was Kleiman
His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's
He called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space
He actively bought and traded a total of approximately 50 coins over a period of months from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014, when he claimed to own ~400,000 BTC
He was paid millions for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive 

Points for creativity at least. 
You just proved my point and refuted your own. Thank you.

he proves a theorem

He copied a proof of a theorem. Badly.
It does not 'refute THE MODEL'. The entire point of 'the mathematics' of his paper is to try to show that the SM cannot get more than alpha of ALL BLOCKS SOLVED (not that SM cannot get more than alpha of the blocks that end up on the blockchain). 
This is not even in dispute, so it appears that Craig is furiously fighting a strawman with the math. 

You're really working hard for r/btc today, unintentionally, and for that I thank you.

Why is it unintentional? Can you point to a single instance where I've said something negative about BCH? 
Are you assuming I'm a 'core troll'? I'd love to see the evidence. 
This junk was debunked here. 
Speaking of lying, are you going to continue to spread lies yourself?

A recent CDC study published in Pediatrics provides important confirmation that flu vaccination can prevent flu deaths in children. The study found that flu vaccination reduced the risk of flu-associated death by half (51%) among children with underlying high-risk conditions and by nearly two-thirds (65%) among otherwise healthy children from 2010 through 2014. 

So you think a 65% reduction in death in healthy children is not worth it?

We know CSW was an early miner,

Evidence?
Isn't this a bit of a straw man? I'm not too familiar with the 'UASF movement', but doesn't User imply that users were running the nodes? That is, each node represented a (single) user with economic interest? I'm not sure you can compare that directly to spinning up a bunch of nodes that don't represent real users, which is clearly a Sybill, and even /u/nullc would agree. 
Is that what UASF encouraged? If so, this is clearly hypocritical.  
Isn't the point that Matt shouldn't have gotten in trouble in the first place? An unfair punishment is still unfair...
Is this one of those, "back in my day, nobody got upset over a little playful ass-grabbing"-type sentiments?
My favorite Craig fact is that his own mom has to call him on his bullshit. 
For more facts about him, see here.

Bill Gates cant write a line of code either..

False. 

The thing is, most likely Satoshi Nakamoto was not a single person but a group of people making the bitcoin a reality

No evidence. 

Maybe Craig Wright was just mildly affiliated with one of the creators, or had some part in the group in whatever form... Maybe he was just a friend of a friend... 

No evidence. 

In any case , this guy has positioned himself in the center of the bitcoin influential group together with the usual famous names, be it core people, block stream people, jihan, roger etc etc... There arent that many influential bitcoin celebs on the planet... but like it or not Craig Wright is on that list... and has influence and money... he happens to prmote p2p cash and bitcoin happens to be created to be electronic p2p cash...

Sure.

so what is your point again?

He is a fraud and liar. Trust him if you want, but be aware.
Huh? That doesn't make sense. 
Please point out the bullshit and/or trolling. I'm happy to clear up anything that needs clarification.  

and a number approaching zero think the Chinese invented it.

Source? Relevance? He also seems to believe that vaccines cause autism. There aren't many people left who believe that. Does that mean he was joking?

Why did I know the instant I read it that is was a joke? Yes the Chinese benefit from climate change regulation, that's what makes the joke. I can't believe people are debating that he could have said that literally.

Do you think the whole birther issue was a joke? 
Why are you so confident that the Chinese hoax tweet was a joke? He clearly thinks it's a hoax, so why does his accusation that China is the perpetrator make it obviously a joke? It seems to me that you're the one to whom facts don't matter. You seem to be putting your opinion (that it's a joke) over the fact that he literally tweeted that.
Citation needed.
I think he’s said enough, personally. I’ve been strongly critical of him, but I think this is sufficient.
That said, he still has the power to do more.
If I could prove it as easily as signing a message, I would!
This is the first I’m hearing about a criminal investigation, as far as I can recall. Do you have a link to that blog post?
Lol. 
I very much doubt it was Hal. He was primarily a C coder and is on record talking about how Satoshi's C++ skills were beyond his. Also, he'd have faked several conversations with himself, complimented himself, and been an early (and fairly frequent) user of MtGox under his own name (see the MtGox leaks).
I used to think there was a good chance (~50%) it was Szabo, but I've backed away from that a decent amount (I'm down to like 5% probability) due to my own research pointing out an apparent contradiction in their use of the word 'cryptocurrency'.
My current best guess is that it's just someone who's not well known in the cypherpunk or crypto world. In other words: none of the above.
/u/btcnewsupdates used to give virtual trophies to Craig on Twitter, but that was before his account was suspended. 

To me, this is a simple lack of respect.

You just called me an 'animal' with 'entitled demands', and you think it's disrespectful for me to say that Gavin should apologize for enabling one of the biggest frauds in crypto? 
With all due respect, take your sanctimony and scurry back to your master. 
Strategy-smategy. I'm in it for the lulz at this point. And lulz there are. 
I see you're not familiar with the concept of 'extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence', huh? 
I'll save you the suspense: there are filings for 'BlackNet', but this supposed 'abstract' will be absent. 
Probably because you call people who realize how much of a fraud CSW is members of an 'anti-cult', post his bullshit, and peddle lies that support his 'arguments'? Could that be it? Maybe it's your refusal to answer direct questions whether you think he's Satoshi?
For the record, do you think he had anything to do with Bitcoin's origins?
This is bullshit. 


Kleiman is not Satoshi. 


Craig was not 'in the room' when Bitcoin was created.


Craig had nothing to do with Bitcoin's creation and neither did Kleiman.


Kleiman did not have the technical skills; the only reason his name is mentioned in the first place is because Craig used his dead friend as cover.
This whole article is bullshit. 

for a couple of grand

This seems far away from "zero", no? 

The article is a material misrepresentation

What is misrepresented? You used another directly-linked article by the same author to 'clear up' the issue. The point of the article is that the Foundation used its funds in illegal ways. Is this not true? Can you point to the words that you find non-factual? Is it just a 'sense' you get? If it is, can you describe how it's different from the times that non-supporters describe their 'sense' of Trump being a raging racist? If you disagree with that conclusion, can you describe the reasoning why your 'sense' is better than theirs? I'm mostly concerned with your methodology, and whether it's repeatable. 

whatever else is in the article is tainted by its inclusion

Even if you believe it to be 'misrepresentative' of the case, isn't this throwing the baby out with the bathwater? The articles give plenty of evidence and reasoning. If you're trying to apply the 'falsus in uno' legal 'principle' (which is rarely actually used), then do you apply that to Trump himself?
Goodness, this is some schlock. 

Here I cannot verify [fake blog posts], but Craig has often talked about ways to mess with the Wayback Machine. Could be bluffing. I don't know. To me it is just an interesting curiosity. I know him to be Satoshi from an overwhelming pile of other evidence, direct and circumstantial.

Wow, what a head-on refutation! An 'interesting curiosity'... LOL.

How exactly do you end up being implicated in a lawsuit as being Satoshi?

Well, when you privately claimed to Dave's father and brother that you're Satoshi and will share money with them, it's not all that unlikely that you'll be implicated in a lawsuit where they want the money you promised.

He knows and understands way too much about Bitcoin that no one else does

No he doesn't. In fact, he is one of the most incompetent around. This doesn't even mention his claim that Bitcoin Script is Turing complete, which is so laughably false that it alone should be a disqualifier. 
Of course, there's no mention of:

Craig faking PGP keys
Craig faking a bitcoin trust and claiming tax credits for it and getting fined over a million dollars for faking said bitcoin trust
The fake public key signing (the 'Sartre' excuse is nonsensical in light of his excuse at the time and the fact that the very next day he promised to provide 'extraordinary evidence' and move bitcoin from an early block)


to enable illegal trading at a base protocol level

I thought OP_CDS can 1) be done with Rabin signatures easily, or 2) be done with a big-ass script. 
Is there something magical about it being an opcode that suddenly makes it illegal?
Obviously, you can't argue that it's because OP_CDS was 'designed specifically for gambling', in the same way you can't argue that Bitcoin was 'designed specifically for the Silk Road'. There are many other non-gambling use cases for OP_CDS, such as:

Covenants
Pay to identity
Zero conf forfeits
Escrow

So, at this point, it's probably a malicious lie to claim that it was 'designed for gambling', right?
Hashrate decides tickers? Funny, I always thought exchanges chose the tickers. 
I still don't see it and I'm looking at where he claims the source is. Can you give a page number?

Therefore there can't be a split unless one side is lying.

This doesn’t follow. Lack of replay protection does not mean there won’t be a split. 
1) Can you ask him why he tried to fake a bitcoin trust to get millions of dollars from the Australian government and how it felt to be caught and fined for it? 
2) Also, can you ask him why he keeps insisting he doesn't make claims about being Satoshi, when he very clearly does?

I can prove access to the early keys and I can and will do so by moving bitcoin ...
So, over the coming days, I will be posting a series of pieces that will lay the foundations for this extraordinary claim, posting independently-verifiable documents and evidence addressing some of the false allegations that have been levelled, and transferring Bitcoin from an early block. ...
I will present what I believe to be “extraordinary proof” and ask only that it be independently validated.

3) Can you ask him why he faked that blog-post 'signing' using a genuine Satoshi signature, but lied about what the text hashed to? I know his usual explanation of it being 'Sartre' and doing it on purpose, but that's clearly a ret-conned excuse, as this was the excuse given on the day:

‘So what happened on Monday,’ I asked, ‘when it came to writing that blog?’
‘I gave them the wrong thing,’ he said. ‘Then they changed it. Then I didn’t correct it because I was so angry. Which was stupid. I put up the wrong one.

And he put up the aforementioned "extraordinary proof" blog post the very next day. Clearly, he still wanted to be known as Satoshi. The 'Sartre' excuse is nonsensical in that light. Can he shed more light on that?
Thanks!
Is trying to defraud the Australian government by faking a bitcoin trust a technique in infosec, too? 
I will, but it's about the fifth time someone's tried to get me to tone down my language. I'm not optimistic it'll stick!
Nah, why does he need 100% confidence? He could just think it’s unlikely that Satoshi will surface and risk it. Conmen take risks all the time. 
Again, I think it's adorable that you're trying to co-opt the word 'cult' to describe evidence-based assertions about someone's (non)-identity. 
Thank you!
Proof of breaking rule number 1.

He said there is no evidence right off the bat.
He said Craig Wright and Dave Kleiman were involved. They weren't.
He made fundamental mistakes, like here and here. In the latter link, he claimed that Satoshi's bitcoin were supposed to be 'tied up in multi-sig addresses, but they didn't even exist at the time.

LOL

If you do not declare assets/capital gains then you will be thrown in jail.

They were supposedly in a 'trust', which would not have been subject to any gains. Besides, gains are normally taxed at DISPOSAL, not at creation. 
There was no reason to 'declare' this when he did.

He knows this, we all know this.

Well, you don't know this.

if you are declaring income or acquisitions of billions of dollars in assets.... you damn right at that point you will apply for the tax credits, so you can end up keeping more of your profit legally

Again, his 'declaring' the BTC had nothing to do with the BTC itself. He pretended to 'borrow' the BTC from the trust and use it to pay for software, which would count as research and development credits. Luckily, the trust was fake, and the ATO discovered that and fined him over a million AUD.

I'm a bit shocked that you put this non-sequitor out there.

Good thing it's not a non-sequitur, then. 
Bad. We should simply make fun of him, like we're doing. We don't ban people who think Elvis is still alive. 
Becoming clear? It seemed pretty clear a year ago when he put out this gem of a comment:

I'm trying to say that there is nothing that precludes Satoshi from being a liar or a scammer. My on thoughts on if CSW is Satoshi or not are private until if and when I decide to make them public.

/u/MemoryDealers, is it time to make them 'public' yet?
First, for being 'newtobch' and only being active for 5 days, you seem pretty confident about this assertion. Where does that confidence come from? Can you define 'base layer' technically? 
Also, why did you delete your recent post?

Oh I've done it,

Lol. Link it and show everyone your pathetic attempt at a rebuttal. 

You sure spam a lot of stuff. Seems desperate.

Now providing copious evidence of my claims is spamming? Wow, this is incredible spin. 

rather than waiting until the wheelbarrow thing later on

Yeah, what overwhelming proof that was! Literally unfakeable. You sure showed everyone! But, just to clarify, why were you claiming to have a PhD in Computer Science in 2015 when you didn't even submit your thesis until over a year later? (Also, the thesis in question is obviously not Computer Science. Do you have another?)

I am laughing from my holidays on yachts

Chartered. 

my cars with sub 3sec 100 ratings

Leased. 
(Not that there's anything wrong with chartering or leasing -- it's just another example of you pretending to be something you obviously aren't -- a billionaire.)

And I could only have done this with the aide [sic, as usual, and mildly ironic] of idiots

We agree, finally! Idiots and the overly credulous have allowed you to flourish. 

MacGregor clearly believed in Wright, however obnoxious he could be, but I never understood why he wasn’t interrogating his uncertainties before spending his money. He was a lawyer, but he put trust in front of diligence

I believe it was actually April of 2013. 
Except for that one slip-up in 2008! /s

The thing that makes him a viable candidate is the fact people like you keep saying he is not Satoshi.

That's some dumb reasoning. 
He is not a viable candidate for many reasons, including his history of lies and fabrications:

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key signing
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)
His own mother admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
He is not technically competent in the subject matter
His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's
He called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space
He actively bought and traded coins from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
He was paid millions for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive

I'll stop pointing out how much of a fraud he is when he stops showing up on the front page of this sub nearly every day.
How about you show me where (in the math) he accounts for the difficulty adjustment. That should be easier. 

There was a large article that came out when CSW claimed to be Satoshi. Think it was a wired or gizmodo article. It claimed that DK was mining btc.

That was part of the 'leaks' connected to Craig. Many things from those 'leaks' have been proven to be fake. 

Yeah what does it prove?

It proves that he didn't change the key configuration after he created them, which is what HIS OWN paper claimed he did! So, since that config was not the default in 2008, the PGP keys couldn't have been made then, since the timestamps would have been different. It's pretty simple, and I'm not sure why you're not following it.
So this evidence is good. Any other examples of 'bad' evidence?
That thread was nicely debunked here.
Give one example of how my evidence is bad. 
By the way, the OP of that post seems to be a shill himself. Ironic.
This reminds me of the time I caught a popular user there using a sockpuppet account. Funny enough, he's in the new thread right now. 
He is not. Speaking of Peter R:
From Peter Rizun:

CSW has told bald-faced lies in public, and his "technical ability" is an order-of-magnitude below what he portrays. What I struggle with though is whether his involvement is a net benefit or a net hindrance to BCH .... and he pushes many false statements as fact too.

My emphasis.
Burden of proof is on him. Nevertheless:

Whitepaper and forum posts are nothing like Craig's style (ask Peter Rizun!)
Wrong timezone to make all the forum posts Satoshi did. The whitepaper PDF also indicated a US timezone.
Provably backdated PGP keys that Craig claimed were legitimate
COMPLETELY FAKED blog posts showing his early involvement with bitcoin
Calling bitcoin 'Bit Coin' several times in 2011
Gross technical incompetence. Also here. And here.
No evidence of C++ proficiency despite many detailed resumes available
He was paid millions of dollars by nTrust to 'reveal' himself as Satoshi (this is for those who think he lacked 'motive')
Pretended to be 'outed by hackers' but that's been debunked. Hackers supposedly 'released' the fake Tulip Trust document, but that's the very document that contains Craig's FAKED PGP keys that he defended! 

Burden of proof is on him. Nevertheless:

Whitepaper and forum posts are nothing like Craig's style (ask Peter Rizun!)
Wrong timezone to make all the forum posts Satoshi did. The whitepaper PDF also indicated a US timezone.

Calling bitcoin 'Bit Coin' several times in 2011
Gross technical incompetence. Also here. And here.
No evidence of C++ proficiency despite many detailed resumes available
He was paid millions of dollars by nTrust to 'reveal' himself as Satoshi (this is for those who think he lacked 'motive')
Pretended to be 'outed by hackers' but that's been debunked. Hackers supposedly 'released' the fake Tulip Trust document, but that's the very document that contains Craig's FAKED PGP keys that he defended! 


Well no, the OP is saying "how long do you think it will take for laws to reflect this?" implying that the laws don't currently do so. That's simply false.

I just listed several things where the laws don't match the opinion shift, so it's certainly not false. To claim that 'several of these are already law' is to strawman the issue. 

Of course things like the death penalty and stem cell research will have qualifications

I don't see how this is obvious. It's very easy to say, "the death penalty is illegal, without qualification", which would be the liberal stance. 

You're acting as if there's this major push to prohibit many of these things, and that's simply not the case.

You're still arguing about the things that don't need to change to reflect shifting opinion. This is not what OP is talking about, so I'm not sure why you're strawmanning it. Again, I'll list the things where the laws CURRENTLY do not match the shift in opinion:

the death penalty
doctor-assisted suicide
polygamy
human cloning
animal medical testing
gambling
stem cell research

And those are only the things polled. 
Is this a serious statement? You're actually predicting that no exchange will list the pre-fork BTC chain if it has significant hashrate? 

The proposed thesis in your claim is that: 1. NIST was hacked 2. The WayBack machine is Hacked 3. The FTP site of the PGP binaries was hacked. And, at the same time, the hash signatures for PGP 1.4.7 just happened to be altered on the Library of Congress site

LOL! What?!
All right, doc. :)

Admitting to libel?

Huh? Libel requires lies. 

You are obsessed, not irony, fact.

LOL, no.
I won't deny I'm trying to discredit Craig Wright. It's quite obvious. It's funny that your response to these facts is to just make up stuff about me:

indicates you're obsessed and you may be suffering from psychosis...

Ironic.
Probably variance. Give it another day or two before you start drawing conclusions. 

Didn't he prove he was though to one of the more trustworthy Bitcoin devs Gavin Andreesen?

He 'demonstrated' it in a controlled environment. When Gavin asked to use his own laptop and USB, CSW got all angry and refused. They ended up using another laptop that one of CSW's assistants procured. In other words, there was ample room for bamboozlement. 

Slander him, call him a liar, etc.

Slander requires it to be a falsehood. I pointed out a very blatant lie of his.

hint that they're in a "religious fever."

I said 'fervor'. Please don't lie. 

Secondly I care even less if he is a scammer or not

OK, fine. Some people do care. 

I also really did not plan on waving qualifications about. I was not going for a job. I did not like that I was expected to offer evidence to anyone, and I still do not. 

Then why did you fake a blog post about it? (Here's the archive link showing that blog post never existed)

How many people do you think believe climate change alarmism is a hoax?

Probably a majority of Trump supporters. 

How many people do you think believe the Chinese started it?

I doubt most people would have an opinion on this. 
You seem supremely confident in your assertion that it's obviously a joke. Yet you have no evidence to back it up, other than Trump's claim 4 years post-tweet (where he then reiterates that China is the beneficiary of this 'hoax'). I thought facts matter. You're making the claim that it's a joke -- can you back it up with facts?
One thing you don't talk about is that the 'attack surface' is not quite the same between Segwit and a simple 4 MB limit. With Segwit, the 4 MB 'attack surface' is only really applicable to malicious miners. If a user wants to create a 4 MB block by submitting junk transactions to the mempool, they'd need to crowd out all the normal transactions, which would be very expensive. In other words, the cost of 'blowing up' the blocksize from a normal ~2MB to 4 MB would be very high.
On the other hand, if it were a simple 4 MB blocksize limit, the 'attack surface' would mainly be vulnerable to users who could easily spam the mempool with low-fee transactions that miners would likely include in the next blocks. If most blocks are around 2 MB, then all an attacker would have to do is to put in a ton of very-low-fee transactions to get it up to 4 MB. That would be a cheap attack. 
It's not exactly apples-to-apples here. Care to comment?

He's smart enough to know that's a useless endeavor and there will still be idiots like Core who continue to call him a fraud

I don't follow your logic here. He won't prove he's Satoshi because people will still not believe him? 
Why did he give a fake but elaborate public proof?

Obamacare made insurance more expensive and people couldn't even get the care they needed despite enormous premiums and deductibles.

This is a very broad claim. Are you talking about the individual market or employer-based? Who couldn't get the care they needed? Are you considering the millions of people who gained insurance who didn't have it before?

He's talking about quality of care relative to price.

For whom? Is it a win if millions lose coverage and the remaining people get better care for a lower price? Can you be a little more clear on this?
Who is claiming that she's the rightful winner? It seems like most people just think this is an unfair system. Something like 70% of the population disagrees with the electoral college. Also, it goes against the idea that Trump has a 'mandate' or that he won in anything like a landslide.
People have been complaining about the EC for a long time, including Trump, ironically. 
Clinton campaign mannequin challenge
More good news in Nevada early voting. According to Ralston, even if Trump wins independents by 20 points (Romney won them by 7), Clinton still wins.

I posted it to btc first. 
I post this stuff here mostly for the laughs.
Yes, you’re not getting it. Read again. Especially the second one.
Here's a starting point. And some more.

Just wondering why someone who prides themselves on insisting on rigorous cryptographic proof would treat a timestamp of all things as reliable evidence.

Nothing is beyond any doubt. If someone moved Satoshi's coins, it wouldn't guarantee they're Satoshi. They could have stolen them or even guessed the private key (though infinitesimally likely, it's still non-zero).

Sorry I don't follow how you determine a priori that the key is fake.

The same way we know that Craig's keys were fake. Do we need to review that?
Yep, here's a gem for you. 
Maybe you're referring to his latest claim of having credit card receipts from when he purchased the bitcoin.org domain name. 
If only there were a better way to prove he was Satoshi...
I'm not sure what I could do to convince you, but it's true; it's just a hobby.

Everyone knows Craig is a liar, so why would Roger bother doing all that.

You could make an argument that it would be a victory for liberty everywhere, since Craig's threats will be even more nullified (not that they're actually real).

Mined coins between 2008 and 2010 inclusive.

2008?! 
Moronic error. Faketoshi confirmed. 
All I can say is tisk, tisk, tisk... [sic].
Edit: For the unaware.
Haha. He still wouldn’t have given anything away. Nobody thinks Craig’s a lawyer. 
Also, Craig’s new account got suspended. He appears to have deleted his old one. 

Remember when Craig Wright suddenly got all obsessed about Kleiman’s estate after finding out he had died?

Craig actually started trading on MtGox before Kleiman died. 
Once Kleiman died, Craig realized he could use his dead friend's company as part of his scheme to get free money from the Australian government. 
Yup, just like he'd never plagiarize! 

Crypto is THE magnet to the crooks and scammers of this world. These guys can't be allowed to succeed.

Irony is dead. 

/u/btcnewsupdates :
We are 100% certain that [Craig Wright] is [Satoshi]:

Not given any reasonable assumptions. For instance, there are surely other means of reducing illegal immigration effectively that do not involve a wall: increased patrols, electronic surveillance, focusing on immigrants who've overstayed their Visas, etc. 
The existence of any one of those effective means makes a wall not 'necessary', even given the dubious assumption that reducing illegal immigration is 'necessary'. 


Anyone who thinks a physical wall built along the US-Mexican border is necessary is suffering from mental illness(es).

Don't be a condescending prick if you don't know what you're talking about. Our existing border walls/fence has [been effective in reducing crossings].

Don't be a condescending prick if you don't understand an argument.
How many fake signings does it take for you to realize he’s a fraud, Forkius?
There's almost zero probability that Craig has actually been trying to re-org from the fork point. The total SHA-256 hashrate has been fairly stable, and all of his pools have been working on the SV chain, with about the same hashrate as they had before the fork. 
The context was hilarious, though. 
Jesus, geekmonk, give it a rest. This is getting embarrassing. 

army of shills and sockpuppets

That's rich coming from someone with his own army of sockpuppets and who got banned from reddit for using a sockpuppet to evade a ban for pushing a pyramid scheme.

SV wants to lock down the protocol 

Their actions contradict this. Their 'Chief Scientist' is now claiming they'll steal users' money if they use an opcode they don't like. This would normally simply be an invalid transaction, but instead it'll be a valid but outputs given to miners transaction. I don't remember that in version 0.1.
How many more ad-hoc changes are we to expect? This ain't 'locking down'. 

if Craig Wright is Satoshi 

Lulz.
I mean, it was my question, so it's natural that I'd be especially interested in the answer to it. 

This is the darkest page in Bitcoin history

Let's keep the histrionics to a minimum, please. 
Anyone know exactly what time this blog post was published? I'm not normally one to talk about price movement speculation, but BCH jumped nearly 10% very suddenly just before 9am EDT today. 
I'm curious if there's a connection to this post, which might be a good indicator of market sentiment for the chains. 

CSW personal attacks years ago after every instance was proved wrong and intentionally malicious

Oh, then it should be easy to give me an example of one of those things, right? 
Pick any of these:

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key signing
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)
He faked a bitcoin trust to get free money from the Australian government but was caught and fined over a million dollars. 

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
He is not technically competent in the subject matter
His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's
He called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space
He actively bought and traded coins from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
He was paid millions for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive

This should be no problem for a superior intellect like you. 
Also, he invented Twitter. 
Fully agree that Craig was envious of Satoshi and these authors. That's why he stole from them!
But what if Craig punched your mom?
I did read it, and I'm not in error. Craig copied it directly from planetmath. 
It's Turing's Vision®
Yep, already happened an hour ago.
He deleted it almost immediately after making it. I'll see if I can dig up the thread. It would have been on the same day as the imgur upload, as I uploaded it right after he posted it. I should have used archive.is or something. 
Edit:
Found it. Also, redditsearch.io seems to have it archived, even though it was deleted. See the fourth result. 
Bonus proof.
I see how a likely shill like you might have trouble understanding, but doing something against the interest of the people paying you makes it more likely that you actually believe it, since you're putting your funding at risk. 
Here's a related quote that applies well to you:

"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!"

Upton Sinclair


CC: /u/jonald_fyookball  since you didn't bother to page him on this hit piece. 
But ... when presented with reason, evidence, and logic for why Craig Wright is a lying fraud, Roger Ver reverts to cowardly evasions. 
No, I don't see what you mean. You implied that I'd respond with the 'same' argument, but it's obviously not the same since you clearly haven't read it to begin with. 
Why are you so scared to read it? 
What do you know, another non-answer from the fraud. 

I don't doubt he could hold some satoshi keys and it seems more evident he does

There is zero actual evidence that he holds the Satoshi keys. Gavin admits he could have been bamboozled, and there are several straightforward ways that Craig could have pulled off the 'demonstration'. We know, for instance, that Gavin didn't even verify the copy of Electrum! 

Yes, the math is right. 

Craig said it's not. 
JVP changed his story though. I would not call him reliable.

The people allegedly "plagiarized" are current colleagues of CSW.

Going to need a reference on that. 
I've also been arguing how the paper is wrong on its merits, but I'm sure you'll ignore that :)
Why are you so concerned with getting me to dox myself? I said it ten times already: there is no part of the math that deals with the difficulty adjustment. Done.
Also, I eli5'd it for you:

Imagine someone gave a proof that the square root of two is irrational. Someone comes along and writes a paper that "refutes" it, by using math that shows the square of two is rational, and demands that people publish a paper to refute it!

The funny thing is that I (and most other critics of Craig) constantly get called "Core trolls", when, if I were actually a "Core troll", I'd be promoting Craig far and wide!
I agree that Craig is good for the lulz, but I'll only truly start laughing once he's fully relegated to the laughingstock status that he deserves. 
I'd consider a signed message from the genesis address sufficient proof. Note, though, if this lawsuit is settled, I will absolutely not call that evidence of Craig being Satoshi. There are many reasons to settle the lawsuit that have nothing to do with Craig being Satoshi. In fact, it's probably in Craig's best interest to settle it.

but if people were trying to extort him and were threatening his children as he claims

So this might be the one thing that's true? LOL!
To recap: 

Blog post FAKE
Tulip Trust FAKE
PGP Keys FAKE
Contracts POSSIBLY FAKE
Threats on children TOTALLY REAL

Death threats like he claims in this article? 

It linked to an article headlined ‘UK Law Enforcement Sources Hint at Impending Craig Wright Arrest’. The article suggested that the father of bitcoin might be liable, under the Terrorism Act, for the actions of people who used bitcoin to buy weapons. Under the link, Wright had written an explanation: ‘I walk from 1 billion or I go to jail. I never wanted to be out, but if I prove it, they destroy me and my family. I am the source of terrorist funds as bitcoin creator or I am a fraud to the world. At least a fraud is able to see his family. There is nothing I can do.’

Yeah, that 'article' that Craig is talking about is totally fake too and probably came directly from Craig himself.
Some more evidence against him: 

Wrong timezone to make all the forum posts Satoshi did
Provably backdated PGP keys that Craig claimed were legitimate
Calling bitcoin 'Bit Coin' several times in 2011
Gross technical incompetence
No evidence of C++ proficiency despite many detailed resumes available
He was paid millions of dollars by nTrust to 'reveal' himself as Satoshi (this is for those who think he lacked 'motive')


I find it ridiculous that such an important figure gets almost anything he says immediately discarded, simply because he did not prove he was satoshi publicly.

Are you serious? I'd wager he's been on the front page of this sub more than any other person in the past month! The top comments are nearly all positive. 

Firstly, if you can not see why Satoshi nakamoto would want to remain anonymous

Craig 'outed' himself in exchange for nTrust bailing out his failing companies. 

Listen to a few of his talks and you will see, he must be one of THE MOST knowledgeable individuals out there about bitcoin there is. 

This is just just plain false.

Why is there such a HUGE smear campaign against him?

I'm unaware of any coordinated campaign against him. I certainly haven't been paid or asked to point out an obvious fraud. I do it because I hold a significant amount of BCH and don't want a fraud and liar to hold any sway in the community. 

Look at the work his company nchain are doing for BCH - it is incredible.

nChain is a patent company. They aren't a charity. Their primary goal is trying to sell patents. Don't get confused.

At the end of the day, regarding his claim to be satoshi, you and I can only truly say that - WE DON'T KNOW.

No, there's a lot more than that:

Wrong timezone to make all the forum posts Satoshi did
Provably backdated PGP keys that Craig claimed were legitimate
Admittedly fabricated blog posts showing his early involvement with bitcoin
Calling bitcoin 'Bit Coin' several times in 2011
Gross technical incompetence
No evidence of C++ proficiency despite many detailed resumes available
He was paid millions of dollars by nTrust to 'reveal' himself as Satoshi (this is for those who think he lacked 'motive')

It's not, of course. The claim is that SBI is worth 500 billion USD, which is also false. SBI is worth about 5 billion USD. Who knows how much the deal is worth.

You have bad character and you are a hypocrite

Evidence?
Thank you for accidentally confirming that you are /u/williaminlondon.
Yes, it's based in London. Craig works there, AFAIK.
Here’s a mountain in case you’ve forgotten. We also have the new evidence that the ‘Tulip Trust’ keys were basically provably backdated. 
It’s hurting your own credibility at this point. 
It's /u/apresents, aka /u/wobsd, aka /u/bitcoincashuser. He keeps getting banned because I keep calling him out. He's now decided to sully my name as petty revenge, I guess. 

As always with you, a semantics argument, and a confrontational comment.

Your headline literally asks to explain the difference between this and UASF. I am directly responding to the topic. There's nothing semantic about it. And I'm not sure how it's 'confrontational'. Is any comment other than "Yeah, I agree with you!" confrontational? 

yet here you are defending it

I'm not 'defending it'. I'm giving a potential explanation, but as I said, 
if you can show that UASF encouraged people to spin up a ton of nodes that didn't represent real users, I WILL AGREE WITH YOU that this is totally hypocritical behavior from UASFers. 
Your claim is that someone being a liar and fraud has absolutely no relevance at all to their future actions or statements?
Because that directly contradicts what you said here:

Wouldn't touch what Greg claims with a 10 foot pole.


based off speculation

There's a lot more than speculation showing that Craig is not Satoshi.
Holy shit, it all adds up! Satoshi said in April of 2011:

I’ve moved on to other things and probably won’t be around in the future.

Craig said this photo was from about 5 years ago. 
He simply forked to a new 'proof of work'. Mystery solved.
Oh stop clutching your pearls. It's just a hobby of mine to expose frauds. 
Craig's deal with nTrust was predicated on his being 'unmasked' as Satoshi. They gave him a lot of money for his 'patents' based on that. They were pretty pissed when he couldn't do it (see below), but it looks like, in the end, they found the greater fool and sold it to an investment company (SICAV). So, I imagine that company cares.
nTrust pissed at Craig (Matthews, Rob, MacGregor are nTrust management):

Rob removed his glasses. ‘The first meeting we had with him yesterday ended with: “You’re fired. Buy a ticket to Sydney. You fucked us. Good luck with the ATO.”’
‘He didn’t sleep last night,’ Matthews said. ‘He looks fucking terrible.’
‘He risks destroying his entire reputation.’
‘His and ours,’ MacGregor said. ‘I’ve been taking meetings with investment bankers for the last two months. I’ve pulled every string I know to get meetings with Google and Uber. If he goes down in flames, I’ll go down with him. I mean, he’s fucked me. Millions of dollars out of my pocket, nine months out of my life. But what we have now is a very pliant Craig Wright. We’re going to drag this back from the brink.’
‘It’s a big task, Rob,’ I said.
‘We finally beat him to a pulp today. No more decisions. This is what we’re going to do, because he knew the next move was pack your toothbrush and get on a plane and good luck in Australia.’ MacGregor told me he’d started Monday morning on an unbelievable high. ‘I can’t believe we kept all the puppies in the box this whole time,’ he’d thought to himself. ‘Nobody broke embargo, holy shit this is going to work. And then … ’

Quotes from this article. 
The old plan (without a subsidy) was that much cheaper than the new one (with a subsidy) the year Ocare was first introduced? Can you give any numbers (even percentages)?
I'm also in the individual market, and if I had qualified for a subsidy, I would be paying a lot less than what I paid before Ocare.
Sure. If I see one clearly operating and people still falling for it, I'll try to call them out on it.

As ASICboost make mining more efficient, it should screw the total hash rate calculation and make it appear like the total hash rate grow.

No, I think this is wrong. ASICBoost makes the miners more energy efficient. It does not increase the hashrate. 
I think this is a fatal flaw to your whole analysis.
Why claim to be Satoshi in the first place? I don't recall anyone suspecting him of being Satoshi until he made the claim.
It's pretty clear that it's his total lack of experience. So, you know, not absolutely nothing.

This is bull. I made $685k last year (adjusted gross). I paid a total of $254k in income tax (federal PLUS state (NJ)). That puts me at 37.1% total tax. For $400k income at that rate, that would be $148k in total taxes. However, it'll actually be lower than that because a higher income has higher marginal rates. 
I am self employed and have very few deductions, so I probably represent the most someone would pay in in taxes at this level of income.
Edit: In 2009, I made $480k. Paid $174k total taxes (federal plus state) for a rate of 36.25%. Works out to approx. $145k for someone who made $400k.
It was a joke, of course.

I don't think he's a US citizen any longer.
Nobody's asking CSW to sign anything. We know he doesn't have anything to sign anyway. It's Roger who can sign.

Tell that to the people who were constantly denouncing Lance Armstrong or Bernie Madoff.

Don’t do drugs, folks. 

Craig Wright is absolutely fascinating as this unstoppable narcissist. I love reading stories about hoaxes and frauds in general, and Craig is even better because he never lets himself play it cool. He will put his foot in his mouth 3 times a day because he can't resist the urge to be a blowhard. You would think that somebody who's been caught in as many lies as he has would slink off the face of the earth in humiliation, but Craig just keeps coming at you with more and more voluminous bullshit, and that's why he's so fun.

Exactly. 
The coin wars are the most boring part of crypto, in my opinion. Bird baths are where it’s at. 
I hear about Matonis (and JVP and Grigg) fairly often. It does seem like there was PR coordination between nChain and Gavin/Matonis/etc.
All on the same day (May 2, I think), Matonis tweeted about Craig being Satoshi, the BBC published an article about it, and Gavin published a blog post.
From Matonis:

I have been contacted by a private group, and I am under a strict NDA [non-disclosure agreement] and press embargo during due diligence phase.”

Apparently, the big reveal had been planned for weeks. (The 'Gavin signing' was in early April.) nChain used the same PR firm that David Bowie used for the 'big reveal'. 
Ha, I did something similar a while ago. 
The code check-in times match the post times almost exactly. 
I think you may be a couple Dr.s short.

I am working on my 4th doctorate.


It's like he exaggerates a truth

There's not even a kernel of truth to his story, though. 

lives as a billionaire

He ain't a billionaire. I'd be surprised if he had $10 million. 
I'm not quoting you, my moronic friend. I'm showing you the power of your 'argument'. 
I got scooped. 
Are you really this dumb or is it an act? 

We dont support him because he is smart, moral or a good person...

Do you have a line that, if crossed, you would no longer support him? For instance, if there were undeniable evidence that he had raped multiple children, would you stop supporting him?
If yes, could you make the line clearer? 
Some background for those uninitiated:
Craig's fraud against the Australian government involved him pretending to have a lot of bitcoins so he could claim that he 'spent' those on research and development, which would entitle him to millions of dollars of free government money. In order to make it look legitimate, he pretended to own a 'bitcoin mining operation' with Dave Kleiman. 
Once the Australian Tax Office (ATO) started investigating this fraud, Craig reached out to the surviving Kleimans to try to get them to go along with his scheme by promising them Dave's share (though it would be in the form of stock in Craig's new venture rather than the original bitcoins, for obvious reasons). Craig knew that the ATO would eventually contact the Kleimans, and he wanted them on his side. Of course, they eventually did contact the Kleimans, but not much came of it. 
The relationship between Craig and the Kleimans ended fairly badly, with Dave's brother asking for a lump sum payment now rather than promises of more riches in the future. Craig, of course, refused. This was what originally prompted the lawsuit. 
Basically, the lawsuit says that Dave and Craig co-created bitcoin (or at least mined a ton), and Craig stole Dave's share. The legal concept they used is conversion. 
The way civil lawsuits work in the US is generally: 


The plaintiff files a complaint. This is what lays out what the facts are and why they think they're owed money.


The defendant (typically) will file a motion to throw out the lawsuit. In federal court (which this lawsuit was filed in), this motion is known as a 12(b)(6) motion, otherwise known as a 'motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted'. 


The way the law works is that, generally, judges only make decisions on matters of the law, and juries make decisions on matters of fact. Therefore, since all this takes place before a trial, all the facts alleged in the complaint are given the benefit of the doubt about being true. 12(b)(6) motions basically say, "even if everything in the complaint is true, there's still no legal case, for reasons a, b, c, d, etc."
What the judgement today says is basically that the Kleimans have a valid legal case assuming that the facts they allege have any merit. Whether they do or not is a matter for a jury to decide (or a judge in certain cases). One immediate consequence is that lawsuit will almost certainly enter into what's called the discovery phase. This is the phase where all parties have to 'show their cards'. The Kleimans' lawyers can request basically any document they want from Craig, and he'd be in legal trouble if he didn't produce it. For instance, they could demand the 'secret' records of mining, etc. Also, at this point, they'd be able to start hiring expert witnesses to verify information. 
In a civil case like this, the burden of proof is 'more likely than not' (aka, 'a preponderance of the evidence'), so if a jury thinks it's more likely than not that Craig stole Dave's bitcoin (which he obviously didn't, since neither had anything to do with bitcoin), then Craig will be on the hook for a lot of money. 
I expect that Craig and his backers would prefer to avoid discovery, expert witnesses, and the risk of a trial, so I expect the case to settle quickly. Craig will get to point to the settlement and hint that it's evidence of him being Satoshi, and the Kleimans will get a couple million. 

calling you out here anymore

You’ve never called me out. Quite the contrary, in fact. 
Dude, fuck you and your misinformation. 
This may be the dumbest take yet. Yes, he’s a fraud and liar. Does that mean he lies about literally everything? No, it just means he’ll say whatever is expedient at the moment. He even will 100% contradict himself, which means he’s telling the truth in one of those scenarios. 
You can be a complete bullshitter and still make huge waves. See L Ron Hubbard, Bernie Madoff, or Joseph Smith. 
I think geekmonk messed up and posted with another alt before signing out.

for example insisting that users need to run full nodes

More non-good-faith comments, since we had an extensive conversation about this recently, and you're again trying to make it sound like I'm saying something I wasn't. Why don't you just quote me directly, since I made it so clear for you?

All right, please show me one of those instances where I suggest that specific users (or all users) need to run full nodes.
Again, for the fiftieth time or so, all I've ever said is that some minimum number of users and/or business need to run full nodes. 

Yeah, he doesn’t have time to respond to two messages, but he can shitpost 50 things a day. 

Your figures are from exchanges that has something like $50,000 24-hr volume which is miniscule.

It looks like it's closer to $4,000,000 24-hr volume, so just two orders of magnitude off. Easy error to make.
This is exactly right. He left in disgrace after his fake signing, only to re-emerge in a new form. 
If it’s not pretending to own a supercomputer company (which he did actually pretend to do), it’ll be something else. 
Thank you for your opinion.
Now here's some actual evidence of his [in]competence.
How the fuck is what he describes a double-spend? It's two different spends on two different chains. /u/ryancarnated, can you explain?
Also, if the 'double-spender' splits their coin with OP_CDS, then how will they send the SV coins? I thought Craig was going to steal them...
Over, I said! :)
I’d pay one satoshi just to send some BSV coins to the wormhole address for the lulz. 

not only does it ensure that no ABC supporters will have any BCH left if the SV chain wins

Why? A user could 'burn' a tiny amount of BCH in one of these transactions as a sacrifice, then split the rest of their coins using that 'burned' address as input. 

This is mindblowing, 

Sure, a mindblowing case of malevolence and user-betrayal. I'm sure this will do wonders for its value.  

This is exactly the reason why it is safe to raise the block size limit now before solving every related scaling challenge.

I think you ought to expand on this. I'm failing to see the logic.

like the bad science you just linked to, when the OP had to edit it at the very end when he was proven wrong. He even admitted he did not investigate the sourced and cited texts for the paper.

Good lord, this is a tsunami of lies. 

No, planetmath copied from the book

They may have based their content on the book without attribution, but they modified it significantly: they have a different list of functions, added a totally different  notation format, and added new text and new annotations, all of which Craig took nearly verbatim. This certainly doesn’t absolve the planetmath author, but neither does it help Craig at all. 
Also,  it doesn’t even address the second instance of plagiarism I listed. 
I read it (again), and cannot find the text used in Craig's paper. Are you bullshitting or do you have a page number?
LOL, the irony is that he made false assumptions, not me -- see here.
He explicitly says that it's an 'attack' when the rules are changed. How is this unclear? Keep in mind, he's proposing to change the rules with SV!

No, Hash can stop chain split.

Can you explain this in detail, please? Are you suggesting that, if there's a split, then the side with more hash should attack the other side to 'kill' it? Or is it something else you have in mind?

The stress test proved that the network won't collapse under extreme load.

No it didn't. It showed that in its current form, the network could handle an artificially throttled transaction rate. It showed nothing about the ability of the network to handle extremely large blocks.

When you are getting flack you are over the target.

Flat earthers could say the same thing. 
/u/tippr gild
The irony of you spending so much time on social media defending the idea that hashpower is all that matters is pretty funny. 
If hashpower is really all that matters, why not just let the chips fall where they may? 
Unsurprisingly, he cites no actual evidence, but instead relies on the opinions of other people.
Maybe the funniest part of the video is where he asserts that the only way to 'disprove that Craig is Satoshi' is to prove that someone else is Satoshi. 
This is ridiculous for several reasons, the most obvious being that this wouldn't even constitute the type of 'final proof' he thinks it would. Borrowing a page from the Craig apologists, we could hypothesize that the new 'real Satoshi' is simply a fall-guy whom Craig paid to 'take the heat'. 
The fact is that it's impossible to prove real-world identity with mathematical certainty. But we don't need that. Evidence that establishes that Craig is not Satoshi far beyond a reasonable doubt is enough to make a firm conclusion. 
/u/ryancarnated Why do you consistently ignore the evidence against Craig?
I agree. It's also incredible that he manages to completely ignore all the evidence that Craig is a fraud.

/u/ryancarnated Why do you consistently ignore the evidence against Craig?

The white paper uses the term "we", like many papers do. That is evidence, albeit weak.

If you take that as evidence, you have to take as evidence the fact that Satoshi says "me" or "I" everywhere else. 
As you said, it's very common (in fact, it may be less common NOT to use 'we') in academic papers.

Your lying on full display is just delicious

You need to work on your sockpuppetry.
Peter, maybe it's time you took a cue from /u/JoelDalais and learned from Craig how to be a better person.

Now that nChain with all it’s [sic] knowledge of Bitcoin

Wow, could the shilling be any more obvious, redditor who’s been active for three days?
Fresh out of arguments, eh?

If you're independent and don't take money, people accuse you of being a fraud/conspiracy.

Not at all. The 'fraud' would be Craig duping people into giving him money because of his claim to be Satoshi, which definitely happened. 

‘The deal had the following components: clear the outstanding debts that were preventing Wright’s business from getting back on its feet, and work with the new lawyers on getting the agreements in place for the transfer of any non-corporate intellectual property, and work with the lawyers to get Craig’s story rights.’ From that point on, the ‘Satoshi revelation’ would be part of the deal. ‘It was the cornerstone of the commercialisation plan,’ Matthews said, ‘with about ten million sunk into the Australian debts and setting up in London.’

Craig is twisting it to mean that nChain is not asking for new investment into their company at the moment, which is not what people are accusing him of. 
It's like the time when people were accusing him of lying about his credentials because he did not have a PhD in 2015 and 2016 (which was true -- he didn't submit his dissertation or receive his PhD until 2017), then he 'proved them wrong' by carting out a wheelbarrow of other degrees, implying those were the things people didn't believe. 
He’s seen the ire that comes with criticizing Craig (which is why I’m getting these ridiculous accusations hurled at me). It’s disappointing to see Jonald falling for the propaganda. 
I didn't realize that the default assumption is that users are trolls, but, nonetheless, here you go:

Calling out toxic sockpuppets
Writing a sockpuppet detection tool
Clarifying technical discussions
Writing a selfish mining simulation
Contributing to Electron Cash

I think the last one you might find especially relevant.

I'm disappointed that I don't get to hear your theories the PGP keys, blog posts, and fake trust! I'm certain they'd be logical and well thought-out. 
Serious scrutiny like you gave when you concluded that leukemia isn't cancer? 
Forgive me for concluding that your 'serious scrutiny' is delusional. 

I have suspicions you're a professional liar.

I have suspicions you're a nutcase. 

is that those are all lies he said a long time ago (2 years ago) when he was forced to come out as Satoshi against his will.

First, he was not forced to come out as Satoshi. He signed away his 'life rights' willingly. 
Also, how do you differentiate the lies from the truth? That is, if those are lies, what makes you think that his claim to be Satoshi is true?
Also, why does he continue to defend the 'lies' about the blog post and PGP keys? Why not just say, "I'm not Satoshi", or at least admit to faking them?

Yet, the comparison has cropped out the multiple citations for those formulas and the previous work leading up to that

The citations don't even come close to what's presented in the paper. 

So, aside from ignoring that these are very common formulas published by many

Why publish the full proofs copied directly from a non-cited source, then? If they're so 'common', why not just refer to the theorems?

it seems this post is the razzle-dazzle

Nice try at projection. 

Given that the source is the same, it's very possible that both parties independently arrived at the same proofs.

I cannot wait until you look more deeply at this. Please get back to us.
About that difficulty adjustment...? Waiting.  
Since you're still not getting it, I'll do an ELI5:
Imagine someone gave a proof that the square root of two is irrational. Someone comes along and writes a paper that "refutes" it, by using math that shows the square of two is rational, and demands that people publish a paper to refute it!
Have you got it yet?
Good one!
We should also consider the possibility that he'll just ignore it forever, or say it's a "lie" without further elaboration. 

the conclusion obviously takes into account DA

No, and here it is explicitly saying that varying difficulties will be discussed later:

The behavior of the system at >51% hash power and at
varying difficulties [...] will also be presented

Again, he does not take difficulty adjustment into account. 
That discussion has nothing to do with bitcoin. At best, this shows that he could have been aware of it at the time. 

Wikipedia claims "In 2011 Kleiman founded W&K Info Defense Research LLC (“W&K”) in Florida as a company to mine bitcoins" but I can't see where they substantiate that.

It's from the 'leaked' Craig documents, I believe. 

Dave's brother Ira claims that it is "irrefutable" that Dave was somehow involved. 

I agree that if Craig was involved, then it's very likely that Dave was, too. However, the antecedent to that conditional is basically nil.

The truth will set you free...But first or will probably piss you off :)

Is this implying that you're moving toward 'team Craig-is-Satoshi'?
Do you dispute that Craig faked blog posts (like this)? Or that he backdated PGP keys? Or that he faked contracts?
No. It would not prove anything, and I have no interest in giving up my anonymity. 

but I want some proof or explanation why he is fraud

Here you go:

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key signing
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)
His own mother admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
He is not technically competent in the subject matter
His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's
He called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space
He actively bought and traded coins from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
He was paid millions for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive

Craig Wright is a serial fabricator and liar. Here's just some of the evidence:

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key signing
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)

I never said Politifact is known to be biased and therefore it's not good evidence

Then why point out that it's biased? Are you now claiming that it's good evidence after all? If it is, then why do you continue to deny that Trump doesn't lie more often?
Hey, we're still all waiting for your evidence that politifact is systematically biased. The onus is on you, since you're ignoring substantial data that Trump lies more significantly just by handwaving a "they're known to be biased". Known to whom?

But sure, the simplest explanation might be that he's a fraud.

Sure, but there's also evidence against him being Satoshi that have nothing to do with this fake stuff.

His timezone made it unlikely that he made the forum posts Satoshi did
Technical incompetence (I can give links if you'd like)
Lack of any evidence of coding skills despite many detailed resumes
History of fabrications predating the current fabrications

Peter Rizun is entitled to his own opinion.

Peter and apparently Amaury Sechet, who is the lead developer of the original BCH client. (And many others, none of whom are 'core trolls'.)

Ok cool as long you promise to write a public apology and donate 10 BCH for him I accept your criticism as healthy.

Yup, I promise. Anything you're prepared to do when it becomes undeniable that he's a fraud?

People like /u/theymos, /u/nullc, /u/contrarian__ and other clowns have been denying that he was involved in bitcoin from the start and even kept spreading lies about how he faked everything.

What about 'clowns' and 'core trolls' like Peter Rizun?:

CSW has told bald-faced lies in public, and his "technical ability" is an order-of-magnitude below what he portrays. What I struggle with though is whether his involvement is a net benefit or a net hindrance to BCH .... and he pushes many false statements as fact too.

My emphasis.

If Craig is Satoshi though, will you Core clowns write a public apology to him?

Well, I'm not a 'Core clown', but I will absolutely write a public apology to him, and donate 10 BCH to the charity of his choosing. 
You don't understand. He did that on purpose to muddy the waters of whether he's actually Satoshi, because he got death threats that he totally didn't make up himself. He was also outed by hackers, who apparently released totally faked contracts for some reason. Don't you read Sartre, bro? 
So he's Satoshi playing a dude who's not Satoshi, because who would be dumb enough to do the obviously fake stuff he's done? You see, the idiocy of it proves that he's legit!  

"The plain truth is that there are more than 300,000,000 firearms in this country and even if you could magically pass a 100% total firearms ban tomorrow you couldn't make a dent in that number for at least 25-50 years."

Are you going to pretend that a 'total ban' would have very little effect in the short term? 

You cannot have and will not get a gun confiscation in America.

Another strawman. The argument isn't necessarily "make ownership of guns illegal immediately". You can 1) ban new gun ownership, 2) ban gun transfers, 3) ban carrying guns in public, etc. 
Yes, which is what I referred to in the next sentence. 
QUESTIONABLE?! He's undeniably a fraud. 
Yup, direct from the horse's mouth!
Ahahahahha!!! Ahhhahahahha!! Oh my goodness, you precious, credulous person. 
Besides that theory being literally unfalsifiable, it doesn't even make sense. Nobody thought he was Satoshi before he made the claim, and nobody would have.
Oh boy. Is English not your first language? Academic papers normally use 'we' even when there is one author. See here for more information.

I started doing something like that on... guess who... Contrarian and then stopped having the time.

Or... you didn't find anything, since there's nothing to find.
Well, he had actively claimed to be Satoshi before that, and he literally admitted to lying about (fabricating) a blog post that showed his early involvement with bitcoin.
So, yeah, he's a fraud and liar.
I read that as applying to branches of a chain that has the same consensus rules. When he says valid, I think he’s referring to attacks. Like, this would apply to attacks that are otherwise valid (eg - a selfish miner forces a chain re-org by secretly mining several blocks then publishing). That’s why he’s talking about ‘they think was first’, etc. 
Looks like it confirmed in just under 3 hours (174 minutes).
So, no, you don't dispute the facts I listed?
The idea is that the facts support the conclusion that Craig Wright is a fraud and liar. 

He successfully conned you?

Where did I say that? I just said he's a conman.

That's probably because you're a idiot. 

Haha!

he teaches people that Bitcoin CAN scale on chain to reach billions of users. THAT is why people try to slander him to ruin his credibility. You are afraid of the message.

Your entire premise is wrong. Feel free to go through my post history to see where I state that big blocks are bad. You won't find it.

Just use some common sense [...] anyone who represents that Trump's literal position is that the Chinese invented climate change is lying.

You keep making these claims but back them up with no facts other than 'it's obvious'. And yet you claim that Harris is the one to whom facts don't matter? You're just going on 'gut feeling'.  

I'm not talking about the birther thing, or the vaccine thing.

I brought them up to rebut this statement of yours:

I can't believe people are debating that he could have said that literally.

Clearly, a Trump position being outlandish, strange, wrong, or even contradictory doesn't preclude it from being an authentic position. This erodes your claim that any claim that's unlikely is obviously a joke.
It comes from many places, including the insurers themselves. But mostly it comes from people who make $250,000/year or more.
I thought your argument is that O'Care is unaffordable for middle class people. Because that's dead wrong. Premiums have gone down on average for the middle-class. Does that make you reconsider your stance?
There's a better archive link: one from November 2009. This clearly shows that there was no bitcoin post. I honestly can't believe that people think he's Satoshi. 

The middle class in NYC is 6 figures and that's Lower middle class.

That's cherry picking. In the majority of the country it's at least upper middle. I'd be fine with a cost-of-living adjustment as a fix, if that's the issue. 

Healthcare is not a right. It costs money.

What do rights have to do with this? Can't one argue, for example, that single-payer would result in lower costs and better healthcare for everyone? That doesn't invoke the unhelpful and ethereal concept of rights. 
As I said, people have been complaining about the EC for a while. To use your baseball metaphor, if I'd been complaining for a long time about a rule that favored the National League, then the Cubs won the series by exploiting that particular rule, I'd be upset. I'd still say they won, but I'd still have reason to be mad and want to change the rule for the future. 
Can you not wrap your head around that?

he repeatedly refuses to admit that the core of the whole thing is a value assumption, not a fact.

It is an axiom, but that doesn't mean it's not a fact (ie - true), just that it can't be deduced from other axioms. The way I read Hume is that any 'ought' statement must rely on a value axiom, which doesn't seem too controversial. 
I think the problem (for Sam) is that literally every other human endeavor has built-in value axioms that aren't questioned. People don't claim that mathematics has no foundation because it relies on value axioms like 'non-contradiction is good'. If that statement is non-controversial, then why can't we say (non-controversially) that the worst possible suffering for all conscious creatures is bad? Sure it can't be 'proven', but we don't demand proof that logic itself is sound.
Maybe the misreading is that many people think that since you can't deduce an 'ought' from an 'is', that means there can be no value facts, or that every one is equally true.
No, I’m going off this comment, which would mean it was April of 2012.

You’re a shit observer. 
Anyone can buy it from PACER.
Let's first see him actually take people to court instead of just threatening it with legal letters.
Also, have you seen the guy? What makes you think he has an 'end game' and isn't just winging it?
He's already been convicted of contempt of court once in his life...
Tweet it to whom? Craig ragequit Twitter, and Peter himself is the OP.
I would probably go on some kind of desert vision quest to reevaluate my entire life, because one of my basic axioms on the value of evidence must be wrong, which implies that I could be wrong about many other things, including whether the earth is round.
Craig and cronies filed many worthless patents. Conclusion? He’s Satoshi. 
Wow, how did this obvious truth escape everyone?
There are only about a dozen as far as I can remember. He writes much better than Craig, but I skimmed one and already found an error:

You will know if you forgot one of them like when
you pass over a hawk missile sight at the edge of base

The next one also has errors:

If you send it electronically through your ISP and they let it get by, are
they now liable if the receiver of the e-mail reports it. [No question mark]

And another:

Note [he meant 'not'] quite perfectly, and not nearly as fast as the built-in option (see below).

also

However, you can wipe the G-List are if you do it outside of an OS 

Compare that with Satoshi's typo/misspelling rate of about 5 in 50,000 words. 
Lol. You have seriously overestimated ‘the man’. 

The hordes descended upon him for what he said

With good reason. I just explained why. Aren't you paying attention?

He has said what he believes

No, he hasn't indicated whether he still believes that Craig is Satoshi. 

so you think you are entitled to an apology now

No, I said I think he owes an apology, or at least he should give his current opinion. 

Newsflash: people are allowed to disagree with you without apologizing

Am I forcing him to apologize? No. Do I think he ought to? Absolutely. Once the truth became known, he had a responsibility to undo some of the damage he (unwittingly) caused. 
If he still thinks Craig is Satoshi, then he doesn't owe an apology. 
What, specifically, do you feel lacks evidence? 
Please keep in mind that my claim is basically that there’s no evidence to conclude that 30% of all democrats and 82% of all independents would approve of the speech. 
The fact that the viewership skewed clearly to the right is why I said that dems who watched were likely more to the right than the average democrat.
Logic isn't your strong suit, eh? 
/u/todu didn't look at the vote count and conclude, based on the count, that you're a Craig moron. He said (in a nutshell), that you're a Craig moron, which explains the vote count. You have it backwards, which is unsurprising considering you're a Craig moron :)

Nice evading of the issue

Lol. For the record, do you think he had anything to do with Bitcoin's origins?

I don't understand your argument.

Try understanding OP first. Here's a hint: even if someone answered 'no' and 'it is necessary' to your questions, respectively, it still wouldn't make building a new wall necessary.
Since this is a legal matter, why not stick to the Federal Rules of Evidence, which indicates the following about what 'relevant evidence' is:

Evidence is relevant if:
(a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and
(b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.

So, it's basically anything that meets that definition. The existence of tax filings on behalf of the Foundation, testimony from those involved, court records, etc. would all fit.
How's that for a start?
Totally clears the Inauguration Committee. Thank you!
He has made similar statements before. That was over two years ago. What makes this different?

Speaking  of 'ideas', though, here's one you floated yesterday:

Rumor has it that ABC manually lowered their difficulty. If true, then ABC is officially no longer Bitcoin Cash


Hypocrit

The word you want is 'hypocrite'. And do we need to cover this again? 
You need to reread our recent exchange one more time. 
Can you translate this to English, please?
Craig didn't invent Bitcoin; Dave didn't invent Bitcoin; Craig didn't kill Dave; Craig just used his dead friend as convenient cover for his lie. 
We can just stick to the hits, then. No chance of proving those wrong. 
I’m not normally one to gloat, but this is the gift that keeps on giving. 

What Bitcoin SV wants to accomplish is enable sound money for the globe.

Sound money is one that can steal from users and redistribute to miners? Interesting. 

When Roger and ABC want to play ball with governments across the globe and turn Bitcoin into something that puts it in legal jeopardy

I thought OP_CDS can 1) be done with Rabin signatures easily, or 2) be done with a big-ass script. 
Is there something magical about it being an opcode that suddenly makes it illegal?
Obviously, you can't argue that it's because OP_CDS was 'designed specifically for gambling', in the same way you can't argue that Bitcoin was 'designed specifically for the Silk Road'. There are many other non-gambling use cases for OP_CDS, such as:

Covenants
Pay to identity
Zero conf forfeits
Escrow

So, at this point, it's probably a malicious lie to claim that it was 'designed for gambling', right?
Some bridges should stay burnt.

CC: /u/Zectro 

For those that just think he's a literal fraud/con man, try listening to some of these for perspective on his expertise.

I’m not sure why you think those have any bearing on whether he’s a fraud. If he’s not ‘the main part of’ Satoshi, then he’s a fraud. 
The fact remains that he’s not technically competent enough to be Satoshi in the relevant subjects, along with all the other reasons. 
This is like finding a video of Deepak Chopra teaching a high school calculus class and declaring him totally legit. 

Algorithms must be getting triggered after certain on-chain volumes reached. 

A much more plausible explanation for the jump was bitcoin.com’s announcement that they’re supporting ABC’s side of the fork. 
Edit: And Binance’s and Coinbase’s similar announcements (thanks for the reminders). 
I would've made a post if I were 'wrong last time', but I wasn't. 

All I see in your post history is you white knighting / brown nosing CSW

Might want to double-check that. I'm not one to get in the way of good satire, but /u/Zectro is doing too good a job of it.
The quickest way is to look for long sections of math and greek letters. They are invariably not his work. 
The text, the notation, the clarification, etc, all come from planetmath (for the first section of my post).  
When it’s about 40% of your entire paper nearly verbatim?
I've tried my best to gather the pro-TTOR (or at least pro 'substantially-miner-chosen' ordering) arguments, and these are the 'best' I've come across:

/u/bchbtch, after saying that there are 'tons of applications if you think for a second', claims that there's a potential use 'where low bandwidth telemetry devices use the blockchain to synchronize'. I found this unconvincing, as you can see from our exchange.
/u/etherbid says that 'miners can order tx's in such a way as to encode messages. (Imagine writing the word "Hello" by merely re-arranging tx's so that the first letter of each txid in sequence spells out a message)'. While it's true that miners are capable of embedding information by way of a specific ordering, they are free to embed information in far more straightforward ways. 
/u/etherbid also says that miners can order transactions so that a client can 'stream' them directly -- as in a video or audio streaming service. However, even with CTOR, this could be done if a service accepted requests for a specific ordering (ie - a client could connect to a full node and ask for transactions in 'natural order').
Finally, /u/etherbid (and his likely alt-account /u/waveconstruct) argue that the current rules allow for meaningful data analysis on things like network topology and transaction suppression. However, it's been pointed out multiple times that this is totally unreliable. 

But he did claim to be Satoshi and failed to prove it. Remember the fake signing?
Neither of these even approaches 'evidence', and the former barely even qualifies as speculation. 
So on one side we have data about code checkin times and post times, quotes from Satoshi, stylometric analysis. On the other side, we have the 'feeling' of one developer...
If your BCH address is 14 quadrillion times more difficult to hash to (in the normal PoW way of leading zeros) than the lowest block hash ever found, I’ll be impressed. Because that’s true of the wormhole address. Did they just get that lucky?
From the blog post:

"Well.. e-gold is down the toilet. Good idea, but again centralised authority. The Beta of Bitcoin is live tomorrow. This is decentralized... We try until it works. Some good coders on this. The paper rocks"

Here is the archived fake blog post. Look at the timestamp of the post: it's January 10, 2008 at 4:30pm local time (AEST). The post says that Bitcoin is 'going live tomorrow'. However, it had already gone live by the time this blog post went up! It had been live for over 4 hours. In literally no sense would 'tomorrow' be correct.
Someone actually pointed this out to Craig on Twitter, but in his usual way, he tersely replied with complete nonsense. 
Again, I ask, how does anyone think this guy is Satoshi? Even his forgeries are technically inept. 
New as of May. The emails are a hoot, though. They read like a Nigerian prince scam. Promises of riches if he complies with Craig’s requests (that will help him in his fight with the ATO). 
This was also released in the lawsuit. It shows that Craig tried to scam the government into giving him millions of dollars. He faked a bitcoin trust and they caught him and fined him over $1 million AUD. 
Get ready for some love, /u/jessquit:

Here you go. Note this tweet, though.
Bulletproof logic, there.
And what a surprise, he's using the publicity he's generating to promote his company. (Read the video description.) 
Bitcoin Cash came to a consensus to hard fork every six months. 
The currently most-used full-node software is Bitcoin ABC. Their upgraded client will hard fork in November with some incompatible changes, including 'Canonical Transaction Ordering' and a new opcode: OP_CHECKDATASIG. 
The newest full-node software is Bitcoin SV, which is based on an older version of Bitcoin ABC. It's being written by nChain, which employs Craig Wright, and appears to be controlled by Calvin Ayre. CoinGeek is owned by Calvin Ayre, so it's pushing Bitcoin SV as well. It also has incompatible changes that will be activated in November, including raising the block size limit to 128 MB, removing a limit for script operations, and re-introducing and rewriting several old opcodes. 
Whether there will be a coin split depends on which miners use which client. 
I'll note that there are other alternatives, including Bitcoin Unlimited, which would likely not end up hard forking. 

I think we as a community need to agree that the longest POW chain will decide what is Bitcoin Cash as Satoshi designed.

Well, you obviously don't think hash power is the only relevant concern when deciding what coin you support, since BCH has minority hashrate compared to BTC. Some people think (erroneously in my opinion) that SegWit makes BTC 'not Bitcoin' any longer because it 'breaks the chain of digital signatures' (it doesn't), which is part of the 'definition of Bitcoin'. Here are Gavin's thoughts on SegWit, for what it's worth. 
Some others think a harshly constrained block size limit makes BTC 'no longer bitcoin'. 
Others think a "central political council of six people who already completely abandoned the original ends and means and replaced them with new ones diametrically opposed to the originals" makes BTC 'no longer bitcoin'. 
The point is that hashrate alone is not what determines what Bitcoin is. Gavin took a stab at making a definition of Bitcoin, and it's okay, but it's certainly not universal. 
If someone thinks that (say) Craig controlling > 50% of the hash rate of a new coin makes it 'no longer bitcoin', then that's up to them. Or if a patent company controlling the most-used client makes it no longer 'permissionless' and therefore 'no longer bitcoin', that's also up to them. Trying to come up with a universal definition of Bitcoin is a fool's errand. Ultimately, it's just social consensus. 
I, personally, will sell any CSW-coins as fast as possible. 

I think people are smart enough to think for themselves.

Sure, to think for themselves, but that's not what I said. However, it's also true that you can lead a horse to water, but can't make him drink, which you showed when you ignored my undeniable evidence that Craig faked PGP keys. Despite the evidence, you still didn't 'think' that Craig is a fraud.  
I don't understand this post. Unless I'm missing something huge, CTOR blocks still have to have the A pays B transaction in the same block (or a previous block) if the B pays C transaction is there. They simply don't have to have it in order within that block. I'm not sure how that makes a difference. The granularity of the 'global timestamp service' can't be better than the block time.
There's never been a requirement that miners order transactions in strict order-received manner anyway, except in the (not-all-that-common) case where one transaction depends on another within the same block.
Ahahaha! Perfect, thank you!

"probably because they havent officially released it yet... "
April 11, 2009 (or later)

I suspect Craig just searched for the URL shortener domain and concluded that it must have existed in 2007 since the domain existed then.

Response timing of email. The delay every time strongly suggest that a great deal of though is put into responses. 

That doesn't even suggest multiple people. He could just be a person who spends a long time thinking about problems; he could be a very slow typist; he could take a long time to get on Tor. 

From a technical standpoint, @ProfFaustus is the only intellectual

My sides!

Why would he not copy and paste and waste his time?

Why wouldn’t he just copy and paste something he wrote himself? Oh, right...

He has repeatedly stated he does not intend any patents at protocol level.

And you think his word is worth anything why?
You can’t be ‘outed’ if you’re not the person. 
Oh please, enlightened one, reveal the Truth About CSW to us!
Here is another fly trap. Please show us all how this is tripe.

anonymous coward

I'm pseudonymous, like Satoshi. My reputation is built into my username. Feel free to browse my history; it's open. My real name is not particularly relevant. However, Roger's opinion (for better or worse) carries a lot of weight for people. It's shameful that he won't give a direct answer on whether he thinks Craig is Satoshi or is a lying fraud. 
You sound like Craig:

Anonymity is the shield of cowards, it is the cover used to defend their lies. My life is open 
and I have little care for my privacy 
Craig Wright - a few months before bitcoin.org was anonymously registered

I hate to dox myself, but you got me.
So what's the theory here? I've been posting for seven years in the same style and good grammar, while Greg's been posting all this time with poor grammar, all in a multi-years-long attempt at concealing a sockpuppet? That's seriously what you think?

You must be getting very short on material if you're having to go through my post history.

What material? You didn't even put up an argument! I'm happy to shoot down whatever cockamamie ideas you have about his fake blog posts, PGP keys, and trust. 

Soon you'll have no ammo left. Your list of accusations against CSW is getting shorter by the week.

Quite the contrary, my acid-causes-all-disease-believing friend. The list keeps growing. 

If the evidence was there you could sue him.

What?? What would the cause of action be? Do you have any idea how the law works?
Can anyone point to the part in the video where he mentions 'Blockstream spies'? I missed that. 
For the most part, he's warning against 'toxic' and 'predatory' people, who "talk nonstop about what they will accomplish" and try to "build a following, a cult", and talk of "rank and competition", and who "throw credentials around lavishly".
Dude is a sociopath. 
These two tweets are all you need to know about him. 
Well, maybe this too.

Then it shouldn't be difficult to refute it mathematically, go ahead and do it.

OK, here goes: no DAA. Whew! Done.

Cool, then again it shouldn't be difficult to refute it mathematically.

Let's try it again, since that last one was so tough: no DAA. Wow, I can't believe I did it again!
Edit: You can try it, too. Here's a proof that the square root of two is irrational. Now, someone claims this proves that P=NP. Refute that mathematically! 

Here is the proof, read the conclusion.

The problem is that the plagiarized math does not match the conclusion. That's a big problem.

The proof takes into account DAA in the math. If you do not agree then quote me the formula in the proof that does not take into account DA.

OK, all the formulas. It is not in the math. Imagine I say, "there is no screwdriver in the garage", and you say, "PROVE THAT THERE ISN'T! SHOW ME IN THE GARAGE WHERE THE SCREWDRIVER ISN'T!" Where do you think I should point?

proving selfish miners lose both revenue and profit.

Wrong. There is no mathematical proof of this. You admitted yourself that you don't even understand the math, so why are you making the claim?!

because in the draft a citation pertaining one of the existing theorems is missing

It's not that he merely copied a theorem without citation (which would still be bad); he copied, almost verbatim, full proofs of the theorems and math, and made it look like it was his own work. Why include the proofs anyway? Nobody would do this, even if they cited the work correctly!
This impersonation is dumb and counterproductive. It hurts those who criticize Craig using actual evidence.
The plan about nChain's patents was made public a long time ago. Here it was:

The plan was always clear to the men behind nCrypt. They would bring Wright to London and set up a research and development centre for him, with around thirty staff working under him. They would complete the work on his inventions and patent applications – he appeared to have hundreds of them – and the whole lot would be sold as the work of Satoshi Nakamoto, who would be unmasked as part of the project. Once packaged, Matthews and MacGregor planned to sell the intellectual property for upwards of a billion dollars. MacGregor later told me he was speaking to Google and Uber, as well as to a number of Swiss banks. ‘The plan was to package it all up and sell it,’ Matthews told me. ‘The plan was never to operate it.’

Show me where it takes the difficulty adjustment into account. No math degree required (though I do have one).
OK, then show me where, in the math, he accounts for the difficulty adjustment. 

If you can demonstrate that Dave wasn't involved with Bitcoin

Here's the trouble, though. What are people willing to accept as evidence? 
Some people still think Dave was Satoshi. However, his writing was unlike Satoshi's; neither he nor Craig have any solid evidence they could code, let alone code C++ at a proficient level.
What would you consider 'solid evidence' of his non-involvement? 
Don't you think it's suspicious that all those company filings were done after-the-fact?

If Ira is not lying

He doesn't have to be lying. He could certainly be unintentionally confabulating, or simply misremembering. It was eight years before. 

Then you are the sockpuppet and shill here. If your opinions were honest you wouldn't be afraid of a live confrontation.

Sorry, that's ridiculous. Anyone who'd prefer to stay anonymous is a sockpuppet, shill, and dishonest?

I will prove how your entire argument boils down to using white lies

Why do you need a youtube interview for that? Just say it here. 
Craig's not a developer though. He's just a plain old fraud.
It's a joke. I spend enough time pointing out how Craig is a liar, a fraud, and technically incompetent that I thought it would be fun to bring a little levity this time.
This is just awful stuff. Here's Sullivan's thesis:

As we have slowly and surely attained more progress, we have lost something that undergirds all of it: meaning, cohesion, and a different, deeper kind of happiness than the satiation of all our earthly needs. We’ve forgotten the human flourishing that comes from a common idea of virtue, and a concept of virtue that is based on our nature. This is the core of Deneen’s argument, and it rests on a different, classical, pre-liberal understanding of freedom. For most of the Ancients, freedom was freedom from our natural desires and material needs. It rested on a mastery of these deep, natural urges in favor of self-control, restraint, and education into virtue. It placed the community — the polis — ahead of the individual, and indeed could not conceive of the individual apart from the community into which he or she was born. They’d look at our freedom and see licentiousness, chaos, and slavery to desire. They’d predict misery not happiness to be the result.

Is this based on any data? He addresses it in the very next passage:

Pinker’s sole response to this argument — insofar as he even acknowledges it — is to cite data showing statistical evidence of rising levels of a sense of well-being in one’s life across the world. And this is a valid point. But Pinker seems immune to the idea of paradox, irony, or unintended consequences. He doesn’t have a way of explaining why, for example, there is so much profound discontent, depression, drug abuse, despair, addiction, and loneliness in the most advanced liberal societies.

So, not really. Does Sullivan think those things didn't exist before? 
Similarly, here's an awful straw-man:

Pinker, for example, has no way to understand our current collective rage — why aren’t we all ecstatic about such huge and continuing “progress”? — unless he blames our gloom and grief and discontent on … bad media. It’s all the journalists’ and intellectuals’ fault for persuading people they’re sad when, in fact, they’re super-happy!

I don't think Pinker thinks that the media is trying to persuade people to be sad; they're rather reporting facts that get them ratings, which usually come from more scary headlines. 
Here's another gem:

We have no common concept of human flourishing apart from materialism, and therefore we stand alone.

Really? Love, family, friendship, volunteering, meditation, etc.
This whole thing in a nutshell: "Things were better back when we worshiped God!"
Good luck getting a direct answer. /u/MemoryDealers is a notorious fence-sitter. 

but his guesstimation is probably accurate, maybe even low balled.

Is this based on evidence or a feeling?
Cool, thanks. Just FYI, if you aren't familiar with the Craig apologists, this evidence will do nothing to stop them. They will just add it to the list of things that Craig faked on purpose to 'muddy the waters' or something. It's literally an unfalsifiable position at this point. Craig could swear under oath that he's not Satoshi and his True Believers would think that's all part of the plan. 
No, please read it again. EVEN IF HE 'GUESSED CORRECTLY', IT WOULD SHOW UP IN THE PGP KEYS, WHICH IT DOESN'T.
This is insane. Quantum mechanical laws?! This isn't a Schrodinger's cat type situation, my friend. 
The problem states definitively that the SM FINDS the block and keeps it hidden. There is no half alive cat here. Who is the 'experimenter'? In this case, the SM KNOWS IT'S HIDDEN. You're doing mental acrobatics to try to rescue the wrong answer. 
They wouldn't have to wait to access the funds, unless they needed on-chain BTC. They have a 'debit card' on their end as well, and can use it just as you can. The funds simply travel between 'debit cards', and the balances periodically settle on the main blockchain. 
Note: I am not a cheerleader for lightning. I'm hopeful that it'll prove useful, but remain skeptical until then.
Yes. As someone who continues to reserve judgement despite overwhelming evidence, it seems like you are either motivated to feel that way, or simply worryingly credulous. 
It's /u/apresents, aka /u/wobsd, aka /u/bitcoincashuser, aka /u/Contrarian-. He keeps getting banned because I keep calling him out. He's now decided to sully my name as petty revenge, I guess. 

let the master BS artists try to wriggle out of this one :D

I, too, await Craig's reply!

Without any knowledge nor facts

LOL. Let us note that, in this rambling and largely incoherent reply, you’ve not even given a hint of a refutation of any of the facts adduced. Telling. 
As predicted.
LOL, coming from the 12 day old account. 
Facts are smears now?
Wait... you want me to stay in this 'echo chamber' so that I don't provide a dissenting view to the other sub? Do you get the irony there?

I heard SPV requires you to trust miners?
SPV doesn't require you to trust a miner.

This is just plain old wrong. SPV nodes follow the chain with the most proof of work. Almost anything the miners decide, SPV wallets will think it's valid. How do SPV nodes make sure miners don't collude to change the reward schedule, for example? 
It's true that fully validating nodes can't do anything directly to prevent miners from something like changing the reward schedule, but they can dump their coins or choose an entirely different currency to use. 

just a reminder that Lightning needs onchain scaling, too.

Yes, this is directly from the lightning whitepaper: 

If all transactions using Bitcoin were conducted inside a network of
micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels
per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require
133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per
year). Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node
with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage.

Agree completely! 
Much appreciated. Others feel free to check my post history for my bona fides. 
Much appreciated, even if this post is bound to get buried. At least some /r/btc users aren't CSW fanatics. 

You're a liar

Please point to any lie of mine. 
The link you gave is comparing unsubsidized premiums before and after Obamacare. Isn't that misleading? Aren't we concerned with actual, out of pocket costs?
From the article: 

Importantly, all of these studies compare gross premiums before and after the ACA without accounting for subsidies that lowered ACA plan premiums.

You realize that there's literally an 'official poverty rate'? You'd think that's what people are referring to when they say, 'poverty rate'. You could have easily cleared up the confusion by saying Supplemental Poverty Measure in your comment. Plus, I didn't claim it was a lie, only a half-truth. 
Citations for your other claim?
*Citation needed.

but it's hard to argue that that isn't an improvement

Incredible. 
We're officially done bed-wetting. Nevada (more electoral votes than NH) is all but locked-up at this point. Plus, NH's bad poll numbers appear to be a non-response bias from the Comey fiasco rather than an actual shift in support. 
Yeah, these two statements are a bit contradictory: 

Slavery did not become immoral because society decided it. Slavery was always immoral, but humans needed time to see that.

and 

we have to decide [our morals] for ourselves

I think if he omitted the latter statement, his argument would be fairly solid.

He did. Here's the quote:
To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now.

"Prosecution and jail time" does not equal "security or administrative sanctions". 
We know who it ain’t.
What a whirlwind of misinformation!

However, it was shown today that this email was submitted as evidence by the plaintiff, not the defendant. 

Shown where? 
"First, before his death, Dave Kleiman (and not Dr. Wright) personally appointed Ms. Nguyen as a “director” of W&K. See D. Kleiman email to U. Nguyen, dated December 20, 2012, attached as Exhibit A"
-Respectfully submitted,
RIVERO MESTRE LLP
Attorneys for Dr. Craig Wright

but that all the emails with fake pgp keys he refers to as "Craig's fake keys" are not actually Craig's fake keys,

You're going to have a really tough time explaining this, then!
Let's hear the theory!
Yes.
Here is Craig's motion. The email is referred to as Exhibit A.
Here.
He’s more like the Gilderoy Lockhart of Bitcoin.
Agreed! Nice job!
LOL.
Does what? Shows his credit card statements?
He knows, but he lies. 

Dave wasn’t a programmer
He made frequent typos in his posts
He died in squalor apparently broke (his $150k house was in foreclosure) while his bitcoins would have been worth millions
The only evidence comes from Craig

Finney was undeniably influential; however, it's unlikely he was Satoshi.
He was primarily a C coder and is on record talking about how Satoshi's C++ skills were beyond his. 

Then there is the language Bitcoin was written in, C++. Satoshi was a master of the intricacies, and I've only seen this in young programmers.

...

I've done some changes to the Bitcoin code, and my style is completely different from Satoshi's. I program in C, which is compatible with C++, but I don't understand the tricks that Satoshi used.

Also, he'd have faked several conversations with himself, complimented himself, and been an early (and fairly frequent) user of MtGox under his own name (see the MtGox leaks).

and alleged knowledge of Bitcoin

Craig knows so much about Bitcoin that he wrote a tutorial on how to write Script. He shows the reader how to calculate truncated subtraction (ie - if (A >= B) return A - B else return 0). He did such a good job!
And by 'good job' I mean he could hardly have gotten it more wrong. His code ends up calculating B - A instead of A - B and it stops and fails if A or B are 0. 
This may be one of the only things I'm confident that he didn't plagiarize.
2014 leak. He started trading in 2013. 
That's not how viruses work. He'll just remain latent for a while and flare back up. 
Kleiman wasn’t Satoshi. 
Well, 'the court' didn't really ask him. Ira Kleiman's lawyers subpoenaed him to produce documents. If you're interested in exactly what types of documents they asked for, see pages 11-13. 
Classic Craig move. First, he has no problem with lying under oath, as he's done it at least twice already. 
Second, this is pure posturing. There’s practically  zero chance that he’ll be deposed or otherwise face legal consequences for this. And even if he did, the onus would be on the authorities to disprove that he’s Satoshi. He wouldn’t be ‘forced to sign’ or anything like that. No prosecutor would care enough to take this case. 
Third, this is part of his strategy of having his footprints everywhere. He’s trying to Gish gallop the subject, and that’s been the strategy from the beginning. That’s how Ian Grigg was bamboozled. He produces prodigious amounts of bullshit and relies on the confusion to convince people. 
If anyone’s been paying attention, he’s been laying the groundwork all along for never ‘signing’ anything. Try reading this with a straight face. 
Yes, it’s fake. Are you surprised?
But here's what YOU are: You think the Earth is 100% NOT Flat. That's actually as dumb as those who think the Earth is 100% flat.
Hey, /u/thedailymath, let's talk about hypocrisy! You were apparently unconcerned about Craig Wright's integrity when he blatantly plagiarized. Specifically, you said:

How does this affect me? How does this affect the BCH hash distribution? Will SV Pool die now that we are aware of CSW's latest plagiarism? How should this affect my opinion of Wormhole and the underlying economic incentives related to willingly burning BCH for a token that will be traded on the open market? How should this affect my opinion of HandCash's or moneybutton's user interface and functionality? My uneasiness towards Bitmain's BCH holdings as they're set to go public? My opinion of the crypto patent race and bankers' attempt to patent the protocol and use cases?
I will not stop saying, IT DOES NOT MATTER. And you won't convince me otherwise. Show me the tangible results of contrarian's detective work, other than boosting his own anonymous popularity in this sub.

So why, all of a sudden, does integrity (in the form of an accusation of apparent hypocrisy) matter to you, vis-a-vis Bitcoin?

Why would you just declare that one tool isn't viable when we're already using that tool?

Again, you are mistaking the  definition of necessary. Necessary != viable.

That's very unscientific. 

LOL. Start with bare logic, then work your way up to science.

No, because we've gotten better results with a wall in areas like San Diego.

'Better' according to what metrics? More cost-effective? Compared to what? This is a fairly broad claim.

There are 22 million illegal immigrants in this country. That's insane.

Why? I swear [illegal immigration hatred] is like a religion with you people.
You're missing the point. Rainbow tables are only useful when the key space of the passwords is smaller than the space of their hash. That's not the case here. 
Note that this fact is the reason that using a strong salt makes rainbow tables basically useless. 

as it’s a land of trolls like you

Evidence-free name-calling. Funny, I thought that was the hallmark of a troll. 

tortuous

You mean tortious, I assume. And unlike Craig’s empty rhetoric about CDS causing legal problems, doing something like intentionally reorging a chain to ‘bankrupt’ an exchange is much more likely to run afoul of the law. 
So, do you expect a new signature from Craig?
I'd think it came from /u/shadders333 or /u/danconnolly, but they don't appear to have any shame about it, so it can't be them. 
I'm just warning everyone that you're a moron and you constantly spread misinformation, like this:

Rumor has it that ABC manually lowered their difficulty. If true, then ABC is officially no longer Bitcoin Cash

It's a perfect demonstration of your technical understanding. 
These posts age quickly. ABC is back 'ahead' at the moment, though, of course, they're different chains.

"I FEED on your BS"

You eat bullshit? 
This argument was wrong yesterday, and, unsurprisingly, it’s still wrong today.
Obviously, you can't argue that it's because OP_CDS was 'designed specifically for gambling', in the same way you can't argue that Bitcoin was 'designed specifically for the Silk Road' or uploading child porn. There are many other non-gambling use cases for OP_CDS, such as:

Covenants
Pay to identity
Zero conf forfeits
Escrow

So, at this point, it's probably a malicious lie to claim that it was 'designed for gambling', right?
This is deluded thinking. First, SV advertised itself as the 'locked down protocol - no new opcodes'. Now they're introducing new opcode(s), ones that have the same byte value as OP_CDS and OP_CDSV, but perform totally new functions. 
If the airline said, "the rules governing these points will never change", then suddenly came up with that rule, you can conclude 1) they are liars, or 2) they are thieves (or both).
The fact is, users may have, before Mr. Wanker's announcement, already moved funds to a P2SH address with a splitting script, relying on SV's claim that there would be no brand new opcodes. Now, of course, if they try to spend them after the fork, they're lost on the SV side. 

when they're forced to switch to using the node software that the rest of the network is on

So, a different chain...
This rape joke doesn’t even make sense. Wouldn’t ‘dropping’ be bad?
PoSF (Proof of Speculative Fiction)

Direct knowledge

Here's the most detailed claim by Grigg about Craig. This is the most relevant part, IMO:

Sometime around early 2015, I was 'involved' through no choice of mine, and since then I have seen a wealth of material. I've not seen a slam dunk proof, and I suspect that is implausible at this stage, but I will say this:
the volume of material that I have seen - documents, personal testimony, discussions in person - added up cannot be forged. That's in my opinion, but I can also suggest I've been around the block a few times. And I've probably seen 100x more than is in the public eye. This shyte can't be forged.

So, in the end, it was the VOLUME OF MATERIAL that convinced him. That was his 'direct knowledge'. It 'cannot be forged'; however, since then, it's been proven that he did forge almost everything! Craig is incredibly prolific, if anything.
It's amazing what convinces people...
CC: /u/DrBaggypants 
His 'legal reasons' are moronic. He links to an example of someone being fined by the SEC for making a fake stock exchange, and handwaves that as somehow relevant to OP_CDS. 
(As a somewhat related aside, the SEC penalty for that site was under $100k. Craig's penalty for his tax fraud when he faked having a giant bitcoin trust was over $1,000,000.)
His argument could have been repackaged and used against Bitcoin itself since it could 'enable illicit drug trade' (eg - Silk Road). 
Thanks for posting this! I think it’s an excellent example of my ability to change my mind when introduced to new evidence. Specifically, see the end of the last link.
So now when people accuse me of being overly stubborn, or a cult member (though who’d be so daft to accuse me of that!), I’ll point them to this. It’s also proof that I don’t simply seek to reinforce my existing beliefs. 
Also, keep in mind that the first three links are from well over a year ago, and the last one is a few weeks old. 
Thanks again!
You can only page users in comments: /u/deadalnix 
Unless it’s a consensus rule. We really need the SV lead devs to weigh in here. 
Paging /u/Coin-Dance, /u/KillerHurdz. 

they dont take time to respond to Reddit trolls

Well it's a good thing that I laid out the undeniable evidence, then, huh?
Do you think it's not a big deal that he intentionally plagiarized these papers?
I don’t think you’re a CSW shill, but here are a couple times you defended him:
Craig’s not a bad guy
Don’t think Gavin was tricked

You're telling me that the man who is investing 100's of millions of dollars

Source on Craig investing (any) millions of dollars?

See: All great works of fiction and art.

Can you point me to some of these where they directly copied substantial amounts of text from someone else's work? Obviously I don't mean it in the 'build-upon' sense. Craig directly copied much of this stuff and didn't even bother to change it. 

Shame on people for chasing a man to show his University degrees 

Yeah, that’s why people call him a fraud...
Can you give a page number? I’ll note that even if it’s in there, the fact that he copied 40% of his paper nearly verbatim without clearly indicating such is still heinous. 
Edit: You said it's in chapter 9, but I still can't see it. Can you give a page number?
Edit 2: I found what I assume you're talking about, and it's clear he copied directly from planetmath. It has the same text, same notation, same notes, etc, all of which Introduction to Metamathematics does not have. This is a clear case of plagiarizing. 

Contrarian has no answer as to how Craig Wright convinced Gavin Andresen Ian Grigg and Jon Matonis.

This is just false. I've addressed it many times. Here is one time I addressed it in great detail. 
I'll even copy and paste some of it:

Gavin went to London already convinced that Craig was Satoshi, so he was not the best example of a skeptical test. This is what got him 'convinced':

But he began to believe in Wright once he started corresponding with him by email in early April. At one point, Wright sent him two emails, one written in his own Craig Wright way, and another one, with essentially the same content, written as Satoshi would have written it. They discussed maths and the history of the invention and the problems it had faced. Within a week, Andresen was sufficiently convinced to get on a plane to London.

Wow, compelling stuff! This is absolutely not what a fraud could do! Keep in mind, it's not like Craig actually had access to the emails between Satoshi and Gavin:

Wright told me that around this time he was in correspondence with Wei Dai, with Gavin Andresen, who would go on to lead the development of bitcoin, and Mike Hearn, a Google engineer who had ideas about the direction bitcoin should take. Yet when I asked for copies of the emails between Satoshi and these men he said they had been wiped when he was running from the ATO.

So we have a somewhat pre-convinced spectator in a controlled environment, and a number of plausible theories as to how it could have been pulled off. This is like coming out of a magic show and saying, "since you don't know precisely how the trick was done, it must have been actual magic!"
As for Matonis, he didn't even ask to use other hardware. He was apparently convinced just by a demo off of Craig's laptop! Literally anyone could change a few lines of Electrum (the software Craig used to 'verify') and make it look like they owned Satoshi's keys. 

CC: /u/markblundeberg 
I'm still not completely convinced, though I think the odds are quite low (< 5%). 
I don't think the evidence of him apparently not knowing about BitGold or Wei Dai is that powerful. If he was making such an effort to be anonymous at the time, it's not much of a stretch to believe he'd just pretend not to know. His knowing of them might give away his status as a 'cypherpunk' member, which is a fairly small community. Szabo had written about pseudonyms being hard work to keep up:

In my limited experience creating Internet pseudonyms, I've been quite 
distracted by the continual need to avoid leaving pointers to my
True Name lying around -- excess mail to/from my True Name, shared 
files, common peculiarities (eg misspellings in written text), traceable 
logins, etc.   The penet.fi site explicitly maintains a list of pointers 
to the original address.  All kinds of security controls -- crypto, access, 
information, inference -- have to be continually on my mind when using 
pseudonymous accounts.  The hazards are everywhere.  With our current 
tools it's practically impossible to maintain an active pseudonym for a 
long period of time against a sufficiently determined opponent, and
quite a hassle to maintain even a modicum of decent security.  Pointers
to info and/or tools to enable the establishment and maintenance of a 
net.nym, beyond the standard cypherpunks PGP/remailer fare with which 
I'm now familiar, greatly appreciated.  Especially nice would be a list 
of commercial net providers that allow pseudonymous accounts.

Similarly, his 'approach' of coding first then writing the whitepaper isn't really too convincing. If Szabo was Satoshi, then he could have written all the code before writing the whitepaper. There wouldn't even be a contradiction. Szabo did ask for help coding bit gold, but there's good evidence that he is a competent coder himself, and there's no evidence that anyone offered to help. 
The evidence of his differing views about scaling is pretty strong, but it's still not terribly unlikely that he changed his mind over time. It's definitely the strongest piece of evidence you listed, though.
However, there's another I'd like to add. In Szabo's first public post about Bitcoin (in mid-2011), he made this comment:

And what's up with the term "cryptocurrency"? What is it supposed to mean? Cryptography is used to protect payments systems as radically different as credit cards, Chaumian digital cash, and Bitcoin. The term encourages the popular but profoundly naive view of Bitcoin as merely another form of digital cash.

If he were Satoshi, this would be a strange comment to make, since Satoshi himself advocated for the use of the term 'cryptocurrency':

While Satoshi never discussed anything personal in these e-mails, he would banter with Martti about little things. In one e-mail, Satoshi pointed to a recent exchange on the Bitcoin e-mail list in which a user referred to Bitcoin as a “cryptocurrency,” referring to the cryptographic functions that made it run. 
“Maybe it’s a word we should use when describing Bitcoin. Do you like it?” Satoshi asked.
“It sounds good,” Martti replied. “A peer to peer cryptocurrency could be the slogan.”

From: Nathaniel Popper. “Digital Gold.”
Speaking of failing to deliver, remember when you said you were going to provide ‘extraordinary proof’ that you were Satoshi?
And do you remember the time you faked a bitcoin trust and the Australian government fined you over a million AUD? Good times. 
Sure we do. 
Fantastic! Please link to it so everyone can evaluate whether you’re telling the truth. 
Never mind, here it is. Thank you for proving how dishonest you are. 

In my experience, this combative personality is symptomatic of an environment in which you have constantly had to struggle with people who are honestly not capable of understanding your ideas and insights

Or, this combative personality is a front to hide obvious technical deficiencies and still maintain a cult following, despite incredible evidence of being a fraud, because certain people have a natural affinity toward people they perceive as 'strong'.  
Jesus Christ... you're not even trying anymore. 
Funny, you used that same emoji before...
I just found another user who uses chatspin and just happens to think  Selfish Mining is mathematically wrong in the exact same way you do.
You are fucking caught!

What Hal said is that he didn't understood some of the C++ structure satoshi used, so he changed it

He didn't say that at all, and there's no evidence that Hal ever contributed a significant amount of code to Bitcoin anyway, especially in the very beginning. 

Don't trust me since I'm a noob in C++, but older style C++ without much use of objects is very very similar to C, so a C programmer can easily refactor stuff to C++ and vice-versa

Sure, but Scronty's point was that Hal was introducing 'newer' C++ specific features like vectors and maps. As I said, all of Hal's actual code was very standard C.
It’s actually a name: “Grumpy A. Narchist”
As far as I know, that message's authenticity is questionable. However, even if it was legitimate, there are several potential reasons why he wouldn't do the same for Craig. The most obvious is that Dorian was an innocent bystander whom Satoshi felt didn't deserve the privacy invasion, while Craig is a guilty laughingstock.  
I absolutely wasn't implying the converse. In fact, I've personally accepted bug bounty payments.

is Turing complete (actually a total Turing machine).

A total turing machine is not turing complete. 

CSW speaks as if everyone knows what he does. This is his weakness.

No, his weakness is that he's technically inept. It is incredibly apparent to all those who are technically inclined. 
LOL.

but since people noticed it and spent time reverse engineering it my guess is it's not in the "days" range.

How many times are you going to spam this comment? Please go back and edit it or delete it now that you know it was only about two days. 

"probably because they havent officially released it yet... "
April 11, 2009 (or later)

I suspect Craig just searched for the URL shortener domain and concluded that it must have existed in 2007 since the domain existed then. 

https://stackexchange.com/users/39783/craig-wright?tab=top

I don't think it's the Craig we know and love. 

the stuff i learn from [craig] is about how to be a better person

Oh lord, my sides!
This is a dude who used his dead friend as cover for his claim to be Satoshi! 
Doesn't get better than this, folks. 

this would disprove his selfish mining working paper

No it wouldn't. The paper didn't rely on gamma being greater than zero.

contrived bullshit

Should be easy to refute, then. Go for it.

You compared yourself to Satoshi. So I dispute that.

I said I was pseudonymous, like Satoshi. I didn't say anything else about my (or his) actions. Now who's dishonest?

What a dishonest person.

.

Character attacks are not an argument

You also seem to have gotten over your aversion to making 'character attacks'. 

Satoshi wasn't a monothematic stalker and agitator.

Nice non sequitur!

Because Roger is not one of those idiots who claim something they don't know.

We know far beyond a reasonable doubt that Craig is a lying fraud. 

Ian Grigg claimed it because he said it's based on 'direct knowledge'. 

As I said before, Ian Grigg was provably duped. He was a true believer in the "Tulip Trust". 

If you don't have this direct knowledge, you can just speculate.

So do you speculate whether evolution is true? Or whether Michael Phelps is Satoshi? Do you need to meet him to determine that?

Lol, Satoshi didn't launch character attacks on reddit.

Incredible non sequitur! 

I agree with Craig.

Shocking.

Character attacks are not an argument, Contrarian__.

I'm not trying to make an argument. I'm trying to shame Roger into finally taking a stance on this issue. 
Let's play a game for a moment. If I say to you that I'm 9 feet tall and refuse to offer any evidence other than some obviously photoshopped pictures, would you call me a liar? 
I don't recall him interacting with me at all in the past several months. Calling out sockpuppets and frauds is just one of my hobbies. 
This actually isn't correct. The reason for the historical shorter-than-ten-minutes average block time is due to increasing hash rate rather than the off-by-one bug in the code. 
The difficulty adjustment algorithm is constantly trying to play catch-up with the hashrate, and it adjusts approximately every two weeks to match the hashrate of that period. So, if the hashrate in the next period is faster, the average blocktime will be less than 10 minutes. 
The bug's effect would be far too small to account for that big of a difference, and if I remember correctly, it actually adjusts it to make it more difficult than it should be, which should result in higher than 10 minute average times.
ELI5: Craig had two PGP keys that purportedly were made in 2008. One was associated with the email address satoshin@vistomail.com. 
However, those keys were unlike the only actual known PGP key associated with Satoshi. They were made using RSA, while Satoshi's was made using DSA, which is weaker, but was the default setting of the software at the time. In addition, Craig's keys used a pref-hash-algo setting that was different from the default from the 2008 version of the software that created the key, but it was the exact default of the later version of the software. 
People thought this was good evidence that Craig's keys were created after 2008. Craig's response was that it was possible to edit the keys after creation to update the pref-hash-algos. His argument was that they were genuinely created in 2008, but then subsequently updated to match the default settings (at some point). This is possible to do with the pref-hash-algos. 
There are at least three problems with this, however: 1) Satoshi never updated his actual known keys, 2) you can't upgrade to RSA after starting with DSA, and (most importantly) 3) updating the keys changes the internal timestamps of the keys. 
The timestamps on Craig's keys were unchanged. The only logical conclusion is that he used a more modern version of the software to create the keys (but set his computer's clock to 2008 when he did it).

a lot of it has been debunked also

Please point to a single issue that's been 'debunked'. I'll wait. 
As if Craig is a mathematician. 
Even his ridiculous publicity photo is mathematical gibberish. 
He doesn't understand elliptic curves. 
His 'papers' are a mess of math.
The most impressive math I've seen from him was plagiarized. 
Even his PhD thesis has numerous math errors.
Yeah, and totally consistent with the time Satoshi posted about how he wanted to make a gold-based currency in 2011 under his real name.

which seems to

It might seem to, but it doesn't. In fact, other researchers have extended Sirer's findings to give an even lower minimum required fraction of hashrate. 
This is in addition to the wide array of simulations available. Are they all wrong? Do you think it's more likely that a proven liar and fraud is right with his handwavy 'explanation'?
Haha!

Anonymity is the shield of cowards, it is the cover used to defend their lies. My life is open 
and I have little care for my privacy

-Craig "Satoshi" Wright, 5 months before the bitcoin.org domain was anonymously registered
Wow, it wasn't a joke!
You honestly believe that I'm Greg Maxwell? I've just been biding my time making all kinds of posts and comments for seven years (four of which I've been posting about bitcoin), adjusting my sleeping pattern, grammar, and writing style, all to give plausible cover for criticizing Craig Wright, when I could have simply made a new account?
Here's a simple test: look at how many times Greg misuses the word its (a pet peeve of mine):

(This is a non-exhaustive list, all found with redditcommentsearch.com) 
Now please find all the times I've misused the word its. Go ahead and pick more grammar errors; I'm quite sure that they won't match between us. 
So you're still going with the theory that I'm actually Greg Maxwell? Keep in mind, you previously pegged me as a "bitcoin unlimited troll". You need to get your conspiracy theories straight.
When are you going to apologize for lying about my comments about Roger Ver, you pathetic swine?
You could (though it would be unlikely), but the problem is that when you update them to newer settings, it changes the timestamps in the PGP key, but Craig's keys' timestamps didn't change! Actually read the link I posted. They are backdated. 
Also, why would he update those settings, but not the actual Satoshi key used by the real Satoshi? 
FUD? Care to refute any of it? 
Pointing out this fraud is a hobby of mine, and I've come to be fascinated by the various defenses and excuses that his supporters have come up with. 
I've been posting about Bitcoin for over 4 years. As I've stated countless times, I own a small business unrelated to Bitcoin, but have significant crypto holdings, including BCH, BTC, and ETH. Craig is bad for BCH, and the sooner everyone realizes this, the better. 

But you will not deny that even today he is one of the foremost experts on blockchain technology

Yes, I deny it. His technical expertise is lacking.

and invited to practically every important (real) bitcoin conference there is.

I fully agree here. He's invited to many BCH conferences. It's ridiculous.

And it's interesting what he has to say.

Interesting is one way to put it.

And that he is still fighting for its success and mass adoption.

Open question. Patents are not exactly encouraging. 

And what are you fighting for?

The truth. 
The vast majority of the documents from the lawsuit come from the Wired ‘leak’. Most of those were proven (or are highly likely to be) fake. 
Even the purported addresses that ‘belong’ to Craig or Dave have been shown to belong to others. 
The technical people are the ones who disagree with him the most. 

But I don't think being a patent troll is their business model.

What is their business model? Do you think their patents are truly innovative and original? 

I trust mathematical proof and the fact that nobody has refuted it.

Many people have. You just ignore all of them. Again, where is the DAA accounted for? Point it out!

If you understand the math then write an article refuting it and let's see how it ages.

I've done better: I've simulated it, without using any of the assumptions that Craig said are wrong. Point out where, in my simulation, I've made erroneous assumptions. 

Says who? You? I trust math over you.

Math that you admitted you don't even understand! LOL!!!

I'm waiting for someone to refute the proof mathematically. If not, it remains valid.

LOL! Oh boy, you are a hoot!
The funny thing is that, before Craig's paper, the actual threat from Selfish Mining was pretty universally agreed to be minimal, on both sides of the block-size issue. It's one of a few things that nearly all bitcoiners could agree on. And I think that's still the case.
The actual problem was with Craig's math.
The 'plan' about nChain's patents was made public a long time ago. Here it was:

The plan was always clear to the men behind nCrypt. They would bring Wright to London and set up a research and development centre for him, with around thirty staff working under him. They would complete the work on his inventions and patent applications – he appeared to have hundreds of them – and the whole lot would be sold as the work of Satoshi Nakamoto, who would be unmasked as part of the project. Once packaged, Matthews and MacGregor planned to sell the intellectual property for upwards of a billion dollars. MacGregor later told me he was speaking to Google and Uber, as well as to a number of Swiss banks. ‘The plan was to package it all up and sell it,’ Matthews told me. ‘The plan was never to operate it.’

Thank you. 
The math is not relevant to his conclusion. No difficulty adjustment. QED.
For the tenth time: there is nothing to refute, since 'the math' in Craig's paper doesn't take into account the difficulty adjustment. He says he will do that at another time:

The behavior of the system at >51% hash power and at
varying difficulties [...] will also be presented. 

How are you not grasping this?

Even if he were to stick in a citation, it would not make this not-plagiarism.

Absolutely agree that even if he fixed it, it would still be plagiarism.
It's practically word-for-word stolen from the paper, and it's not included in the references. Where did he bring up the paper himself, and why wasn't it included in the references?
Evidence? 

I know you strongly believe Satoshi was one person but that has never been particularly plausible to me.

There's just no evidence that it's more than one person. All the theories about multiple Satoshis are brought up to explain discrepancies in the stories (like here with the coding, or the timezones of the posts, style, etc.). The whitepaper and forum posts have a similar tone and style. Plus, keeping a secret among multiple people this well is much more difficult than if it were a single person. 

Perhaps an email or post somewhere from 2010 where he remarks about having just found out about Bitcoin?

But if there's nothing about bitcoin, isn't that almost as damning?

Yes but not terribly. Lots of legal paperwork happens after the fact.

Sure, by itself, it may not be incredibly suspicious. But that's on top of the enormous pile of provably faked things that came from Craig. What are the odds that this is legit?
Edit: Wow, what's with the downvotes in this thread? We're both getting it.
Sure, but what evidence do we have NOW? Until we have evidence, we should leave Kleiman out of the conversation completely. 
It looks like the name changed in 2014 to "C01N", and the papers 'appointing Dave Kleiman' weren't filed until after he died. Am I misreading it?

You're saying it's impossible for SM to have a temporary lead of 5 or 10 blocks? Sure, it the long run, he cannot outpace HM, but for any fixed lead of length N, there is a nonzero probability of him achieving it (temporarily). 
All that has nothing to do with a concept of negative gamma, which is the proportion of honest miners who would mine on a block released by a selfish mining pool right after an honestly mined block. You can't have fewer than zero honest miners do that, can you?

Then refute the discussions you claim are lies with facts.

I did, but then you said that it doesn't matter and you trust me even less now. Can you explain that? 

Dear Greg,

Ironic that you're the OP trying to elicit controversial opinions and you start off by childishly misrepresenting me. 

I have personally refuted all your points several times.

No, you presented a bungled mess of speculation, as you're doing here again.

your points 1)-7) do not prove that he is not Satoshi but that he has faked blog posts and given fake proof in public and has had issues with the Australian Tax Office.

So you agree that he's a serial liar and fabricator? You're just trying to excuse the behavior?

Your points 1)-6) are blatantly false as he sold several blockchain patents to nchain back in 2014-2015

That's exactly what I said. How does this make it false?

he mined bitcoin in his old house and (among others) his email exchanges with Dave Kleiman prove that he was involved with bitcoin from the start

Any evidence of this that hasn't come from Craig himself?

Dave Kleiman's estate is suing him for $10bn of bitcoin mined by him and David Kleiman.

As I pointed out here, that lawsuit was a good idea regardless of whether Craig is Satoshi or not.

he provided private proof that he is satoshi to Gavin, Matonis, The Economist and the BBC

Exactly, no independently verifiable evidence, like I said. 

it is overwhelmingly likely that the reason why he did not do that are the illegitimate activities bitcoin was used for in the early years of its creation

This is just bollocks. It doesn't even make sense! He wants to be known as Satoshi, but also doesn't. Try spelling out your theory in full. It does not add up. It also ignores my points 2 through 5.

He also one of the most competent, if not the most competent personality out there when it comes to Bitcoin.

Sorry, this is utterly wrong. In addition to the link I already gave, see this and this. And here's Peter Rizun's opinion:

CSW has told bald-faced lies in public, and his "technical ability" is an order-of-magnitude below what he portrays. What I struggle with though is whether his involvement is a net benefit or a net hindrance to BCH .... and he pushes many false statements as fact too.

Note this is not the same guy who threatened to resign if Trump got rid of Mueller. That guy is Don McGahn, the White House Counsel (ie - not Trump's personal attorney). 
If McGahn leaves, that'd be a much more ominous sign. 

Satoshi likely isn't just one man but a few guys working together. 

Zero evidence for this claim.

And Craig fits as one of the team members, so... 

No he doesn't. His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's, there's no evidence he could code C++ (or at all!) at the time, etc.

Also have you considered he doesn't care to prove it?

Oh how convenient! Note that there's no evidence that he received any threats. In fact, he appears to have made that up as well:
Death threats like he claims in this article? 

It linked to an article headlined ‘UK Law Enforcement Sources Hint at Impending Craig Wright Arrest’. The article suggested that the father of bitcoin might be liable, under the Terrorism Act, for the actions of people who used bitcoin to buy weapons. Under the link, Wright had written an explanation: ‘I walk from 1 billion or I go to jail. I never wanted to be out, but if I prove it, they destroy me and my family. I am the source of terrorist funds as bitcoin creator or I am a fraud to the world. At least a fraud is able to see his family. There is nothing I can do.’

Yeah, that 'article' that Craig is talking about is totally fake too and probably came directly from Craig himself.

How could someone read that complaint and come to that conclusion?

Because there's still no actual evidence he's Satoshi? 

So a person with a serious case of the flu in the USA and without insurance or money to pay for healthcare, will certainly not go to the doctor due to costs, which then probably leads to more deaths due to simple illness.

You are just making this up until you provide evidence! I'm not saying you're definitely wrong, but this hand-wavy explanation is junk until you back it up with data.

You guys have low life expectancies compared to developed countries, are you telling me that the health care system doesn't impact that?

Even if it does, that has very little bearing on the issue at hand. Again, until you prove that access to hospital services explains the 65% reduction in death that flu vaccines provide in healthy children, you are just telling stories.

Is that true?

Yes, this referral period ends Wednesday. It gives free supercharging for life.

Does that mean the referral codes are going away too?

I don't think anyone knows for sure, but I expect there will be a new period with a different reward. 
It's beyond a reasonable doubt at this point. 
It’s in the OP under transcript. 
Yeah, it's funny. It seems whenever I post it on a Craig thread, it gets buried and downvoted. Funny, that. I wonder why. At least here, it might get some exposure.
Since my other comment got downvoted by Craig acolytes, for anyone who didn't see it, the blog post referenced by /u/Raineko here is completely fabricated. Craig admitted it himself.
Yeah, he admitted that he faked that blog post. 
Good catch!
It might be reddit's site-wide rule that limits your posts when your subreddit-specific karma is low or negative. Check by going to your userpage and click the top right "show karma breakdown by subreddit".
It's true that this sub isn't completely uncensored. The rules clearly state that excessive profanity will result in a ban, for instance. However, I personally haven't seen anyone get banned only for expressing an unpopular opinion. That's probably more what people are referring to when they say this sub is uncensored. 
Of course that's what he wanted. I'm not sure why people think it has to be such a complicated story. It's spelled out pretty clearly in the O'Hagan article (amongst a fair bit of intrigue). Read these two quotes:

‘The deal had the following components: clear the outstanding debts that were preventing Wright’s business from getting back on its feet, and work with the new lawyers on getting the agreements in place for the transfer of any non-corporate intellectual property, and work with the lawyers to get Craig’s story rights.’ From that point on, the ‘Satoshi revelation’ would be part of the deal. ‘It was the cornerstone of the commercialisation plan,’ Matthews said, ‘with about ten million sunk into the Australian debts and setting up in London.’

and

We spoke about Wright’s possible lies. I said that all through these proof sessions, he’d acted this like this was the last thing he ever wanted.
‘That’s not true,’ MacGregor said. ‘He freaking loves it. Why was I so certain he’d do that BBC interview the next day? It’s adoration. He wants this more than we want this, but he wants to come out of this looking like he got dragged into it.’ He told me if everything had gone to plan, the groundwork was laid for selling the patents. It was a really big deal. He said Ramona had said that if Wright doesn’t come out you still have this really smart guy who has made all these patents, who knows all about bitcoin.

A few EDAs have already locked in (but no more will), and it's now 40% more profitable to mine the bitcoin cash chain. It's operating at 4% of BTC's difficulty, and is trading for about 6.3% of the price. BTC.top alone has mined 10 blocks in the last half hour. 
It transcends poetry. It's pure truth trapped in the form of English. 
It's written more for those who have a passing familiarity with Craig. Also, the Craig apologists use that fact as 'evidence' that he actually just wants to 'kill' the Satoshi persona so that 'we are all Satoshi.' It's a bizarre 'reluctant Satoshi' story that doesn't make sense at all.
I love the tulip trust document. It's written exactly in Craig's style, and includes language like, "a record of this will never be filed in the US or Australia".
The saddest thing about it, though, is that he uses his dead friend as cover. Scum.
Best TL;DR I can manage:
The PGP key in question (from Nakamoto Dundee) is supposedly from 2008. However, it has metadata associated with it (pref-hash-algos: 8 2 9 10 11, and other things) that match the defaults from the gpg tool if it were generated in 2009 or later. 
So, one of two things happened.
1) It's a forgery 
2) The key is actually from 2008 and whoever generated it happened to choose those exact pref-hash-algos (in that exact order) that became the default later (along with several other incredibly unlikely coincidences). (Note, it wasn't updated later.)
Greg's claim is that 2) is unbelievable enough to dismiss the keys as 'clearly a forgery'. However, CSW's argument is that it's not LITERALLY impossible for that to have happened.

The ironic thing is that it's actually NOT germane to any Satoshi claims, because that PGP key has no evidence of being associated with Satoshi anyway!

Whether anyone believes he is Satoshi as he frequently hints at

He directly says he was ‘the main part of [Satoshi]’. 

there simply never was proof either way, make of it what you will.

Well, whether his infamous ‘Sartre’ bullshit was meant as proof is up for debate. Either way, he’s not Satoshi. 
Get some facts. 
Why not?

Keep being the hero we need but not the one we deserve!

Doesn't get much closer than that!
OK, well that's for you to decide! And everyone else!
Solid rebuttal guys! :)
But unless you ran a full node yourself, you'd still have to trust the business(es) claiming that something nefarious is happening. And you're just wagering that there will be businesses doing that. Why wager when you can trust yourself? 

not knowing what that means 

I saw that post about ad-hominem. I'm surprised he didn't double-down on his clear error. 
Must've missed that, sorry. 
And you just proved my point. 

I trust no one. End of story.

There are levels of trust. I assume you trust your Starbucks barista not to poison you. 

you provided absolutely 0 proof to support your claim

I provided a lot of evidence. When making claims of identity, there will never be mathematical proof levels of certainty - only varying degrees of evidence. The evidence here is rather overwhelming. It's very surprising that you can't see it. Actually, you refused to see it, since you said you stopped reading! 
Sure, but it would be very compelling evidence that it's him. I'm not sure what you would consider irrefutable proof of his identity. 
Are you not aware that less than 2% of abortions are performed past 15 weeks (over 6 weeks before earliest viability)? And the majority of those are for congenital issues (like abnormalities that will result in a painful, short life if they're born).

Do you support Bush's 2002 born alive clause?

No, and not limited to the fact that it applies even to 12 week old fetuses, which clearly have no sentience.

I'd probably draw the line on that to be anything that is a white collar crime or worse.

So if Trump ever got convicted for a while collar crime (or worse), you wouldn't vote for him if he runs again?
Thanks for the clarification!
OK, but that doesn't really get to the heart of my question, which is: would you vote for anyone, regardless of their qualities as long as they align with you on certain political positions? Imagine your choices were Justin Trudeau (assume for this hypo that he was born in the USA) or a republican whose foreign policy stance, SC nominee choices, etc. you agreed with. How bad (personally) would the republican candidate have to be for you to either not vote or vote for Trudeau? Like, could he or she be a convicted serial child rapist who got out on a technicality? Adult rapist? Drug smuggler? Where's the line (if there is one)?

The middle class were taxed

Evidence?
That's the worst comparison I've ever heard. If you own a business, you seek out loans. They're not guaranteed to you. If you're injured and a hospital treats you, it's like a guaranteed loan. Plus, if a business fails, only the ones who provided the loans have lost money. So not alike at all. Got it?

If someone can't pay their bills the hospitals write off the costs of the treatment as "bad debt"

A write-off just decreases tax liability. It's not magic. Someone has to pay for the treatment, and it mostly falls on those with health insurance. 
But you are already free-riding to some degree. What happens if you're in a terrible accident and your medical costs are > $1,000,000? Should you be left to die, or should the hospital treat you?
I doubt the lie had much direct effect on anything. All I can recall is being sad and angry. Of course, as an adult, I realize that they (like all people) have a variety of motives.
Utilitarians maximize well-being in the long term. Here's a simplified example with made-up numbers that fit your hypothesis.
Consider this: 
In the past, either gay people talked about their homosexuality (+1 to them and -1,000,000 to non-gay people) or they didn't talk about it (-10 to them and 0 to non-gay people). Notice that in both cases, then numbers are negative.
From now on, there is only positive! When you consider that humanity will most likely exist for a very long time, it was most certainly 'worth it' from a utilitarian perspective. 
A hash function takes any number and turns it into a number in a certain range (0 to 2^256 -1 in Bitcoin's case). If you use the same initial number, the 'hashed' number will be the same, but if you use a different initial number, the 'hashed' number will be different. 
Example: 
hash(283) = 23777203982
hash(284) = 9837403792814839
Hashes are often called 'one way' because it's normally impossible to guess what the first number was by looking at the 'hashed' number. In this example, you can't guess that the input number was 283 if you were only told that the output number was 23777203982.
So with Bitcoin, the miners are trying to get an output number lower than a certain threshold. Say that threshold is 5000 (this is the 'difficulty' in the Bitcoin protocol). They have to keep trying numbers until they get a number such that hash(num) < 5000. For example, they try the number 3829. They see that hash(3829) = 2770, so that means they won! They show everyone their number (3829) and everyone sees that its hash is below 5000, so they 'win' this block.
Now, they don't just get to pick any number they want to try. The current 'block' they're trying to solve has a structure where they can change a few things about it. Since the block is just binary data, it is actually just a big number. But they can change parts of it. (The nonce, etc).
Imagine that the underlying block binary data (in decimal) is: 90007000283720. They are only free to change the '7000' part, ie (90007000283720). So they keep trying hash(90007001283720), then hash(90007002283720), then hash(90007003283720), then hash(90007004283720). All of those hash values were over 5000. Eventually, they see that hash(90007355283720) = 4809. That's less than 5000, so they show everyone their number and collect their bitcoins.
Note I'm using much smaller numbers for simplicity. 
The key is to not think of bitcoins as separate entities. There's no such thing as a 'single' bitcoin. It's all just numbers in ledgers. You can transfer 0.003BTC or 5.000BTC just as easily as 1.000BTC. 
Here's the best analogy I can think of: bitcoins are stored in 'addresses', which you can think of as similar to email addresses. 
With email, you can send and receive messages, but with bitcoin addresses, you can only send or receive a number (eg - 0.828 or 89.77639). 
Whenever you receive a 'bitcoin email', your 'bitcoin balance' increases by whatever the number was. Then whenever you send a bitcoin email to another bitcoin address, your balance goes down by that amount. 
Let's do a simple example: say your bitcoin address is rj@bitcoin and I (jm@bitcoin) send you 0.5BTC. Your balance is now 0.5BTC. You want to send 0.2BTC to bob@bitcoin. 
Under the hood, each 'bitcoin email' signs itself with your password so everyone knows it's from you, and it also references a previous email you received that will 'pay' that amount. 
So in this case, the full email will say something like: pay 0.2BTC to bob@bitcoin using the 0.5BTC I got from jm@bitcoin. Also, pay the change (0.3BTC) back to my address (rj@bitcoin). By the way, this email is valid because I'm signing it with some private data that only I have access to (similar to a password).
I understand your point, but it's not quite the same. 
Look at it this way: he could buy a multi-million dollar house with $200k taxes per year then complain that his tax rate is 105%. It's not fair to just automatically include it. I wasn't saying that he should not count it at all, just that it's not exactly comparing apples to apples.
It would be nice if I could dictate exactly where my taxes went. There is plenty of bonehead spending, but on balance, I am happy to live in a country that has some basic social services. In fact, I'd prefer to pay more in taxes in exchange for public healthcare and a generally more European style of government. 
I grew up in a lower middle-class family and have earned every penny I've made, but I'm certain I couldn't have gotten here without a ton of luck. It's a myth that the rich deserve to keep everything they make. I work harder than most, but there are a ton of people I know who work harder and make 1/20th what I do. 
Edit: A common argument is that people like me are 'producers' in the Ayn Rand-ian worldview. I tend to look at it from a different perspective: few of us do what we do solely to make money. Baseball players would still play baseball, doctors would still practice medicine, and teachers would still teach. 
Anyone can buy it from PACER.
No. When Craig inevitably backs down, they'll just think of him as a martyr.

Why don't you go convince Ryan X Charles

I’ve tried. He’s in too deep. Also, he’s proven himself a bad actor.
It’s just for fun. I’m not paid for it.
Yes, because that was me. 
It’s not on this list because I can’t fit everything. There’s just too much!
He could still sign a message 'anonymously' saying that the address never belonged to Craig. It wouldn't have the same force, but would still be better than nothing. 
He's signed messages with that address before, so it's not like he can't do it.
Huh?

But Kleiman was a genius

Evidence?
Lol. 
No. Craig’s not Satoshi. Dave wasn’t Satoshi. Craig just used his dead ‘friend’ as convenient cover for his lie. 
The post's score indicates otherwise, no?
Also, it's 'no one', asshole. 
You scooped me. Here's the direct bitcointalk link. 
Maybe try clicking on the link from the post and looking at the date. If you weren't aware, 2008 came before 2009.
That's his only law degree, though he claims to be 'working toward' a 'doctorate of law'. However, he does not have it yet, so his claim of being a 'lawyer' is wholly based on the LLM.

I remember reading that he emailed Kleiman’s relative letting him know his son had a fortune on a an encrypted hard-drive and half of it was his or something. 

It’s like the start of a Nigerian prince email...
Try this one. No matter how hard you or Craig try, Script is not Turing complete in any sense. You’re free to say this is nitpicking over semantics, but words have meaning, and there would have been no issue had Craig not made a patently false claim. 
In reality, there are probably more people who are 'obese' than the BMI says.  
BMI as a test of obesity is highly specific; that is, if you consider body fat percentage the gold standard, then if you're 'obese' under the BMI test, you're almost certainly 'obese' under the body fat percentage test (under the generally accepted definitions of obesity). If anything, BMI under-estimates obesity in a given population.
Source: http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=2877506
So, given that Trump has an 'obese' BMI, he very likely is obese by the bodyfat percentage measurement. Do you understand? 

Weird that Kleiman's attorneys didn't enter that as an allegation. Surely they'd be competent enough to at least be aware of it.

That's an excellent point. I think it deserves some further explanation. 
You must keep this in mind: it's in Kleiman's best interest that Craig is Satoshi. 
Anything that establishes Craig, and especially Craig and Dave, as being Satoshi (or at least owning a ton of bitcoin) helps their case. They are happy to point out that he's faked a bunch of contracts, etc., but only to show that Craig is trying to defraud Kleiman. 
People seem to have an expectation that this lawsuit will somehow inevitably arrive at the full truth. This is not the case. For instance, Craig may try to enter something into evidence that shows he's Satoshi, and Kleiman's lawyers may just stipulate to those facts. That is, they'll just agree to them without contesting. Some morons on Twitter think that individual pieces of evidence have to meet some kind of standard of proof like 'beyond a reasonable doubt'. This is laughable. I'll repeat it to make it clear: even if some kind of fraudulent document gets entered into evidence, that doesn't mean it's been vetted AT ALL. The judge only makes decisions on legal matters (eg - is something legally relevant). 
Finally, even if the case eventually comes out in favor of Kleiman, that doesn't imply that Craig is Satoshi. The burden of proof in a civil case is 'preponderance of the evidence' (is it more likely than not). If the jury only sees that Craig is Satoshi, and Kleiman's lawyers don't contest that, they'll be operating on a faulty set of facts. 

if CSW would provide it, you or others will say it’s fabricated

Does it give you any pause that Craig has already been proven to backdate multiple bitcoin-related documents?
Do you think there's a good chance this is genuine? What probability would you assign to it?

I believe CSW has stated that he and DK even setup a company just for mining BTC, W&K Defense Research..

LOL! There was a company with that name, but what makes you think it was for bitcoin mining?! Craig's word? You're so credulous it's adorable. 

Billions of people have jobs working for people with no moral center, doing tasks that move humanity backward.

True, but how is this relevant? 

Why are these two special?

Because they work for one of the biggest frauds in the crypto space, and this sub is about crypto.

I don't blame them. Everyone's just trying to get by.

I do. I very sincerely doubt that this is the only employment they could get. What's the harm in shaming and blaming people for working for an obvious fraud? They have a choice, and so do any other current and future nChain employees. 
Ha, that's great. How do you know it's in .docx format? 
Lol. 

why can´t David Kleiman be Satoshi? CSW was his business partner and CSW allegedly stole his Bitcoins after he died!

Neither Craig nor Dave could code. Neither had anything to do with Bitcoin's inception. 

when was the first time that CSW claimed to be Satoshi? only after both David Kleiman and Hal Finney died?

His first documented claim to be Satoshi was February 11, 2014 in an email to Dave's father. His claims before that (starting in mid 2013) were limited to his just owning a lot of bitcoin. The lie expanded because the tax authorities were after him for attempted tax fraud, and he needed the Kleiman family's support. 

but the article states Trump told Cohen to lie just after the election

I don't remember reading the just. Can you point that out? The relevant line I see is this:

Now the two sources have told BuzzFeed News that Cohen also told the special counsel that after the election, the president personally instructed him to lie

There's a big difference between "after the election" and "just after the election", no? Isn't your entire comment predicated on that difference?
In fact, the article directly states that the documents show he was asked to lie to Congress:

The special counsel’s office learned about Trump’s directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents. Cohen then acknowledged those instructions during his interviews with that office.

I wouldn’t call it fatal. It’s a trade off between reorg risk and split risk. 
It's been longer than that, and I expect /u/memorydealers still considers me a pain in his ass. 
I'm just glad he eventually came around. Let's not rub it in^(too much). 
Spoiler alert, it’s fake. 
Not necessarily with the same mean or variance, though. 
Geekmonk, at least wait like 10 minutes before reposting your own stuff. 
I think it's premature to make that kind of declaration. Even if SV has more hashrate initially dedicated to it post-fork (which is far from a foregone conclusion), ABC supporters still could have other options, including: 

Building in checkpoints, so that if they have an initial burst of blocks with CDS transactions, SV can't reorg the chain without building atop them (and having to modify their client in the process)
If SV plans on constantly reorganizing the chain using empty blocks or mutually compatible blocks, the difficulty will drop significantly and quickly, which, if the price held, would mean that miners from BTC would switch because it's more profitable to mine BCH. That could tip the scales toward ABC.


There are many good reasons to fake blog posts

LOL. Let’s hear all about it!

now you are reporting unsubstantiated claims from Kleiman estate as fact. 

Wait, you think Craig didn’t email the Kleimans with the claim that he was ‘behind’ Bitcoin? They just made up the emails? Funny that Craig’s lawyers didn’t dispute it. 
For anyone interested, here are the emails. I’ll let you be the judge of whether they’re genuinely from Craig. 

Deliciously uncertain whether he is playing you or not.

Hahaha! Like it’s so uncertain that he faked that bitcoin trust and committed perjury twice. 

My pleasure...we're known for asking "hard questions" 

Yeah, why do I doubt that?
Though if you actually mean it, I'd appreciate you asking why he:

Faked his PGP keys to make it look like he was Satoshi
Was fined over a million dollars for faking a bitcoin trust to claim free money from the Australian government
Perjured himself at least twice

Basically. He conned a billionaire into thinking he's Satoshi. 

why does he have more hash than anyone else now

BTC hash dwarfs BCH hash. 
Yeah, and the main way it's been proposed is as a conditional, so that no money would be 'burned'. So you're fighting a strawman and you know it. 

It's not stealing if someone throws out their money to be unspendable 

How many times are you going to repeat this lie? This is, what, the tenth time at least?

The reality is you have grossly underestimated him, and are likely all in for a rude awakening in a few days. CSW is a dick, but he is a dick that is 20 years ahead of anyone else in this space. Too far ahead and too indifferent as to your affection for him to make more than the most passing and spotty efforts to explain or validate himself. Dig if you want to know the truth.

This is like generic cult leader apologia. You could have copied and pasted this and it would’ve applied to L. Ron Hubbard when he was alive. 
Because we know he always tells the truth. 
The torch has been passed.

Satoshi Nakamoto would serve life in prison if caught, just as Bernard von Nothaus served time for the Liberty Dollar.

Jesus Christ, these aren't even  remotely similar:

Federal prosecutors successfully argued that von NotHaus was, in fact, trying to pass off the silver coins as U.S. currency. Coming in denominations of 5, 10, 20, and 50, the Liberty Dollars also featured a dollar sign, the word "dollar" and the motto "Trust in God," similar to the "In God We Trust" that appears on U.S. coins.

He was charged with counterfeiting. 
Why isn't Vitalik in prison, then, or Charlie Lee?

This means if the SV chain ends up winning anybody using DSV on the ABC chain will lose everything

I just explained to you why this is a dumb statement. Why are you repeating it?
Yes, please, anyone who believes this, subscribe to r/ibch and unsubscribe from this sub. 
Then why did you say 'most likely' a collective?

It is at this point that Bitmain will accuse Coingeek of being a malicious miner and an attacker, when Coingeek will be simply exercising its right as a miner to vote with CPU.

It’s still an attack. The key is intention. 
The white paper describes an ‘attack’ where a miner follows all the rules of bitcoin, yet is still labeled as an ‘attacker’. Read section 11 again. 
Ah, nuts. I thought I'd finally get someone willing to back up their talk. How about a much smaller amount? 0.21 BCH? 

Ian even writes that he was present in one of those key transfer events.

No details, except that he wasn't there "physically but net-wise." LOL!

Also, how can you say that some material has been proven to be forged when you haven't seen the material in question?

That post was before the Kleiman lawsuit, where hundreds of pages of documents were released for the first time. Unless you think there's an entirely different set of documents, those are almost certainly the ones he's talking about.

Or he was just bamboozled, right? It's quite magical how CSW is able to fool these amazing minds

Yes, he was bamboozled, and it's entirely unremarkable that a conman managed to trick 3 people out of thousands. 

CSW is able to fool these amazing minds, but anonymous reddit nobodies see through it all

Bernie Madoff managed to trick dozens of billionaires, yet several 'nobodies' were calling him out on his fraud well before any charges were brought. I await your special pleading here.

Anyway, Jan 2020, we just might see those coins move. Of course it would only prove that CSW has access to Satoshi's keys..

Want to make a bet?
Of course, this is just fun now. A bit of schadenfreude. Just a bit. 
Projection at its most pure. Here’s heuristicpunch being civil to me:

You are a faceless rat. The only good thing Adam ever did to bitcoin core was to kick you out of Blockstream. You are stage 4 cancer.

I’ve been discussing bitcoin since before he was shilling Chatspin (which I think was supposed to be a Chatroulette knockoff, like five bucks is a fiverr knockoff). 

No because BCH is a separate coin

And so will SV be. 
In his more recent paper, he straight-up says that the language is Turing complete:

Consequently, we have
demonstrated that bitcoin script language is Turing complete.

You are terrible, geekmonk, but this is a new low. 
Ah, good thought. 

It's pure BCH driven market reaction.

Don't be silly, as /u/heuristicpunch eloquently argued:

Miners are the market

Again, I'm compelled to add /s.
Thanks! Assuming that's correct, that's 8am EDT. Amaury tweeted it at 9:17am, so we know it existed before then. Quite the coincidence if the price jump wasn't triggered by this.
As far as I can tell, it's the biggest jump up since late September. 

You are a rotten human being. Your tears are fake, your words are lies, your soul is damned. rBitcoin is evil, but you are just as evil as them. They were right about you.

What did I say about those histrionics? Please get a hold of yourself. 
Hey look, it’s /u/drippingupside’s sock. 
For the record, there only could ever have possibly been 20,999,999.9769 bitcoin. That doesn't count the unspendable ones (genesis block, OP_RETURNs, etc.), the lost or 'burnt' ones, or the purposely unclaimed.
Edit: In case my 'count' language was unclear, you'd subtract all those from that number (20,999,999.9769) to get the 'actual' maximum number of bitcoins in existence. However, that might not be a good idea, since (theoretically) someone with enough hashpower could rewrite the chain from the genesis block and 'recover' those. In no case other than bugs would the number of bitcoins that could ever exist exceed or equal exactly 21 million. 
Have you gone off your meds?

a long history of starting out as a core shill back in August last year.

Evidence?
Yup, he couldn’t handle a basic discussion and just ragequit. 
I’m sure he’s watching my posts, though, given his network of sock puppets. 
Hi Geekmonk!

ASSumed he used planetmath as his source.

He did. Show me in the Kleene book where it says:

Starting from the simplest primitive recursive functions, we can build more complicated primitive recursive functions by functional composition and primitive recursion. In this entry, we have listed some basic examples using functional composition alone. In this entry, we list more basic examples, allowing the use of primitive recursion:

That’s one of the two places he plagiarized from, and he absolutely did. Show me in the Kleene book where it says:

Starting from the simplest primitive recursive functions, we can build more complicated primitive recursive functions by functional composition and primitive recursion. In this entry, we have listed some basic examples using functional composition alone. In this entry, we list more basic examples, allowing the use of primitive recursion:

I’ll wait. 
Goddamn it, the jig is up. 
The second source gives it away, too?
Better luck next time.

It's very difficult to conduct a proper technical discussion when you start by claiming that CSW is lying and misrepresenting stuff. 

Why does that make it difficult? It's a statement of fact.

I don't care if Bitcoin Script is Turing Complete or not.

But Craig claimed it was. That Script is 'useful' is not a controversial opinion, nor is Craig the first person to note it. Then when people (rightly) criticize Wright for making a ridiculous lie, his defenders claim he's being 'attacked' and say that we should 'listen to his knowledge', when the only new thing he brought to the table was bullshit. 
And it's not like this is the first time this has happened. He made some headlines around Selfish Mining when he claimed it was not worth worrying about because it's not mathematically possible. Only the latter part of that statement was novel, and it was, again, total bullshit.
That's why he's treated with disdain among the technically competent. 
Then take some time to understand the arguments. 

Since ordering now is based on the time that you sent the transaction with each sentence, your book will be written to the block in order.

Absolutely no guarantee of this, unless you make a chain of transactions, each dependent on the last. However, if you do that, you can still recover the order just fine with CTOR, since you just need to do a DFS on the DAG (AKA a 'topological sort'). Nothing would be lost in this case, except maybe a few CPU cycles. 

Drastically changing bitcoin via changing the transaction ordering rule and losing Natural/Topoligical Ordering is going to turn BCH into an altcoin.

Citation needed. Or are you referring to this deluded post you made under your alt account? Or are you referring to this comment you made about the 'deal breaking' property of CTOR:

To me that is the biggest deal breaker.... is that miner's must perform a SORT on an already sorted block to verify the entire thing is SORTed.

As I pointed out to you, that's totally untrue. Why have you not reconsidered? 

Adding an expensive CDSV that throws off the economic incentives

It's the same 'expense' as an existing opcode that's used in nearly every transaction. It's actually slightly cheaper. 

Then you make another transaction that spends the output of that transaction with a P2SH script, and also includes your entire wallet balance as other P2PKH inputs in the same transaction

Ah, I knew I was missing something. Using a worthless, sacrificial P2SH input is pretty clever, thanks!

This test compared her DNA to two groups of Europeans.

No, it used 99 Americans with European background and 86 British people.

The average white American is 1/516 Native American.

How confident are you in that link you provided? It comes with the caveat:

It is important to note that the study has several potential biases that should be taken into account such as the socio economic status of those who might have purchased the test and as Carl Zimmer reported in his piece, the fact that people of mixed race are more likely to get the test out of curiosity. 

This part, in Warren's study, seems especially pertinent:

The segment on chromosome 10 observed in the individual is larger than any of the segments
identified as having Native American ancestry in any of the 185 reference individuals

So she has 'more' 'Native American' ancestry than the 99 Americans of European origin (from Utah). Don't you find that significant? 
The 'innovation' is that it's supposedly 'symmetric' and uses nChain's patents. 
However, it's a terrible solution because it has an inherent race condition since it's symmetric. Since the nLockTime must be equal (to be symmetric), whichever party reveals its secret first is at a disadvantage (say Alice), since the counterparty (Bob) can wait until just before the locktime is reached and submit their transaction (which reveals Bob's secret). However, Alice may not be fast enough to submit her transaction claiming Bob's credit before Bob uses his (nLockTime hindered) refund transaction. 
In other words, imagine Bob submits B3 in the block just before nLockTime n is reached. Alice has lost her potential refund transaction and Bob still has a shot at refunding his own money in the next block!
Tier Nolan's scheme doesn't suffer from this problem, since the lock times are different for offeror and offeree. 
Craig by orders of magnitude. Phil has a handful of emails, a flimsy short story, and an interview or two. Craig's been cranking out forgeries, emails, contracts, interviews, fake signings and more for about five years now. 
Lying under oath at least twice for starters. 
Here's one time where he swore under oath that he controlled bitcoin addresses he absolutely didn't.
Here's another one where he swore to be a 50% shareholder in Dave Kleimain's company, and the new affidavit where he swore to never have any ownership interest.
From the first:

The shareholding of W&K Info Defense was:


Craig S. Wright 50.0 %


David A. Kleiman 50.0 %



From the second:

I have never been a director, member, shareholder, officer, employee, or representative of W&K or of any Florida business.


Just to pick one point. You have no evidence this is true. 

Lol, sorry, buddy. There's plenty of evidence. 

‘The deal had the following components: clear the outstanding debts that were preventing Wright’s business from getting back on its feet, and work with the new lawyers on getting the agreements in place for the transfer of any non-corporate intellectual property, and work with the lawyers to get Craig’s story rights.’ From that point on, the ‘Satoshi revelation’ would be part of the deal. ‘It was the cornerstone of the commercialisation plan,’ Matthews said, ‘with about ten million sunk into the Australian debts and setting up in London.’

and 

The Wrights’ financial situation was dire. They couldn’t pay their staff and a number had already left.​ Pedersen and some others had stayed on without pay; Wright owed his lawyers $1 million. Superannuation remittances were overdue and loan repayments unpaid; the companies needed £200,000 just to make it to next week. Craig and Ramona had sold their cars. 

and 

Within a few months, according to evidence later given to me by Matthews and MacGregor, the deal would cost MacGregor’s company $15 million. ‘That’s right,’ Matthews said in February this year. ‘When we signed the deal, $1.5 million was given to Wright’s lawyers.

and 

As I was paying the bill, Matthews reared up. ‘You know Craig has gone out and bought himself some cars? One hundred and eighty thousand dollars’ worth of cars.’ (When I checked this with Wright he said the cars were leased.) ‘One of them stands out like the dog’s balls in the proverbial moonlight, and this is from the man we’re trying to keep fucking secret.

So, at absolute minimum, Craig's multimillion dollar debts were paid off, which absolutely would qualify as being 'paid millions'.  

You are just an anonymous coward on the internet, pursuing a personal obsession. Coward.

Sorry if it makes you angry to see your hero taken down. 
I’m not writing for you. I’m writing for those being duped by Craig. Well, I guess I am writing for you, then, in a way. 
I also like that, rather than addressing any of my points, you simply namecall without any supporting evidence. 
This is how it’s done: Craig is a fraud and liar and here’s why:

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key signing
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)
He faked a bitcoin trust to get free money from the Australian government but was caught and fined over a million dollars. 

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
He is not technically competent in the subject matter
His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's
He called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space
He actively bought and traded coins from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
He was paid millions for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive

Again, a claim without a shred of evidence. Please give examples, at the very least, because this, so far, is a perfect example of the ‘political chest beating’ you’re talking about. 
... he says with absolutely no evidence. 

political chestbeating

Sorry, bud, I make claims and back them up with evidence. 
Did we read the same thing? Craig offered to ‘buy out’ Ira’s ‘shares’, but promised him oh-so-much more if he played along. Ira asked for the money (Craig’s original offer), then suddenly Craig balked and backed out. This is like scam 101. 
Correct, I am utterly unworried. My account is almost eight years old and I've never been shadowbanned like you have. It sounds like you are worried, though! With good reason.
LOL, says the dude with a network of sockpuppets!

You assume motives.

There is a deep history of motive with Craig. For instance, here is where Craig tried to defraud the Australian government by claiming an optional tax credit by faking a bitcoin trust. They caught him faking it and fined him over $1 million AUD. 
Eh, you're done. Deny it all you'd like, buddy. Virtually every user who's posted about chatspin either posts in /r/btc or has also shared one of the same deals as you have. It's funny watching you try to explain it away. Keep trying!

regardless of whether you technically promised or didn't promise proof

Let's not pretend he didn't promise proof:

I can prove access to the early keys and I can and will do so by moving bitcoin ...
So, over the coming days, I will be posting a series of pieces that will lay the foundations for this extraordinary claim, posting independently-verifiable documents and evidence addressing some of the false allegations that have been levelled, and transferring Bitcoin from an early block. ...
I will present what I believe to be “extraordinary proof” and ask only that it be independently validated.

It also doesn't explain why his 'Sartre' post used a real Satoshi signature that he pretended to validate using a text of his choosing. It's so obviously a post-hoc excuse that I'm utterly shocked that anyone  bought it.
In fact, at the time, he claimed that someone else messed up the blog post!:

‘So what happened on Monday,’ I asked, ‘when it came to writing that blog?’
‘I gave them the wrong thing,’ he said. ‘Then they changed it. Then I didn’t correct it because I was so angry. Which was stupid. I put up the wrong one

Explanation needed!
When he said:

I’ve done some changes to the Bitcoin code

he was talking about the changes he made years after it was released, which is not when Scronty is referring to. 

I just meant to say he didn't understood satoshi's code

If Satoshi's code was C-like C++, why would he make it more 'modern' C++? 

Vectors behave pretty much like dynamic arrays, a feature of C but absent in C++ (which uses vectors).

You can use C-style dynamic arrays in C++. Basically you just have to use new and delete instead of calloc and free.
No. 

Yeah it seems he's seen enough to convince himself, somehow, though vague.

The funny thing is that a lot (all?) of that 'non-public' stuff has since been released through the Ira Kleiman lawsuit, and basically all of it has been proven to be fake, so his entire premise is bunk.

In reality, he claims nothing

What are you talking about?

Based on my own research, I do think he was a part of the Satoshi team, if not the leader.

You need to do more research.

There IS evidence to show he was an early miner.

No there is not. 

There IS evidence to show he had enough hardware to mine Bitcoin and collect over 1 Mil Bitcoins in a relatively short time.

No there is not. 

There IS evidence to show that saw an opportunity to make megabucks out of mining Bitcoin and took it. 

No there is not. 

There IS evidence to show there is a Tulip trust (for tax dodging purposes) 

No there is not.

There IS Evidence to show he was researching/learning and getting very deeply involved with the nuts and bolts of Bitcoin from early on.

No there is not, unless you count 2013 as "early on".
I encourage technically adept people to look at Craig's stuff; it will only convince them more that he's technically inept. However, many BCH members are incapable of judging whether something is technically sound or not, so they rely on trusted authorities to do the vetting for them. Unless you expect ever single member to be a technical expert, this is providing a valuable service to the community. 
Seems Craig is doubling-down on it! What a surprise :) 
Let's see how this one plays out. 
And if he taught a class on it, you’d think he’d have a copy of his own version of hello world. 
I don't think that saying applies when there are a thousand words in the picture.

these days

You mean all five days your account has been active?
And talk about smear campaigning...

says the anonymous person

I'm pseudonymous, like Satoshi. My reputation is built into my username. Feel free to browse my history; it's open.
You sound like Craig:

Anonymity is the shield of cowards, it is the cover used to defend their lies. My life is open 
and I have little care for my privacy 
Craig Wright - a few months before bitcoin.org was anonymously registered

It was crystal clear that this conversation wouldn’t be fruitful. 
I don’t think it’s 2019 yet. 
What a cop-out. Lame. 

Isn't he a mathematician with degrees in Mathematics and Statistics?

Well, he makes a lot of false claims, so I don't know. He certainly doesn't have a PhD level degree in math or stats.

Either way I have seen him have a better grasp on probabilities/statistics

Specific examples of the math in question? 

who fail to even debate the SM issue on mathematical terms

Please read the entire section entitled "Correctness of Algorithm 1" in the paper I linked. 
Thank you!

Edit: my point is: criticise professionally.

This is rich. Just yesterday, you posted this compelling and professional criticism of an argument I made:

His defense is crap

And is this really a 'hunt' (though I think you mean 'fight' - you're (maybe purposely) mixing idioms), as opposed to a ridiculous farce? Do you think there's even a minute chance that I'm actually Greg? 
Doesn't it bother you that Jonald has fallen for this obvious bullshit? 
Do you do all of your development for free? Do contributions only count if they're unpaid? I can almost hear the goalposts shifting now. 
And you ignored everything else. Do you still hold the delusion that I'm Greg?
I continue to await the apology. 

on a troll

Please give some evidence. I have only engaged in good-faith argument, and I've backed up any non-obvious assertions with evidence. 
I patiently await your evidence (or apology). 

every claim I've read against the man turned out to be twisted bullcrap.

So he didn't fake blog posts showing his early involvement in bitcoin? He didn't backdate his PGP keys? He didn't fake a bitcoin trust to get tax credits from the Australian government? 
I can't wait to see you 'untwist' this.


In all this, Zectro's account was created few months after the fork

Anyone who clicks on my account can see that it's four years old,

The important thing is that /u/heuristicpunch remembers that your account is not that old, and you're clearly just sanitizing your account to evade his watchful eye. You're a trickster who's clearly in the employ of Bitcoin Unlimited AND Blockstream AND probably the CIA.

There's a lot of strangely consistent things there

It's actually full of holes. 

Did you see the logo construction?

Yeah, and it's bullshit. 
This isn't even a new idea from nChain and Coingeek. Check out this post from 2011, when the idea was proposed and subsequently discredited:

Here's another possible simple rule for miners that might work (but, as Hal said, requires Deep Thought):
"When I see a new block with transactions that I didn't see broadcast previously, mark those transactions as suspicious.  If I see double-spends of those transactions, stop building on that block-- assume it is cheating.  Switch to the previous block (or alternate block if there's a block race going on)."
Miners won't try to rip off a grocery store for $50 worth of groceries if doing so makes their $50+ bitcoin reward for finding a block disappear.
This rule would also give miners a strong incentive to detect and refuse to include EITHER side of a double-spend in their blocks (if they get both spends while they're working on the block).

Then the rebuttal: 

There are no incentives for doing that. If 98% of the network "discourages" a block, then those miners have a small chance of losing their blocks to the 2% that does not discourage the block. However, not discouraging a block has no penalty at all.

And OP's response to that:

Excellent point.  Although there should be a meta-incentive to make the bitcoin system successful, so there are lots of transactions (and lots of transaction fees for the miners).  Certainly big payment clearing houses that want instant payments to work have the right incentives...

The same thing happened a couple months ago, when Peter Rizun pointed out essentially the same thing. 
Also, from the same thread, does this argument sound familiar to anyone? 

I think it is a reasonable assumption that major miners will be well-connected with each other.  There is certainly a strong incentive for miners to be well-connected in general (better connected == more likely to win 'block races').

I seem to recall someone taking credit for this concept recently...

First of all I should say that the bolded does not perfectly match sources overall

But the first sentence of your title implies that 0-conf transactions are "safe", and you're using the concept of 'incentives' to explain why that's the case.

But the reason I added that source to that particular part is because it references the time stamping process of the first transaction.

Sure, but the actual 'timestamping' only happens when a block is found, which means it's no longer 0-conf.

The incentives are basically group pressure aligned with PoW.

Can you go into more detail on this? Perhaps explain what would happen if a miner published a block that included a transaction that conflicts with something in all the other miners' mempools? Are you claiming that this block would be more likely to be orphaned? Is it something else? Can you be specific, please?

The incentives model is derived from Proof-of-Work, which in combination with protocol and client settings creates the positive pull needed to ensure that it is always more likely that nodes will only accept the first transaction that they saw and record it in a block as soon as possible.

Your sources do not back up the bolded part of the claim in this section. 
Source 1 (from the whitepaper) describes the blockchain, not the mempool. The blockchain is the timestamp server:

we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received.

The 'a system' here is the blockchain, not the mempool. 
Source 2 does not address first-seen. It only talks about the likelihood of a single transaction making it into the next block.
What are the incentives for only keeping the first seen transaction (or disincentives for replacing it) in a given miner's personal mempool? 

What I do know is that no one can say he isn't SN. So why not let him be? He no longer claims it, he doesn't care what people think. I know some people don't like that he refuses to deny it, but just because he hasn't proven it to you doesn't mean it isn't true. 

It's not true because he's an inveterate liar. Here's just some of the evidence:

He faked blog posts
He faked PGP keys
He faked contracts and emails
He faked threats 
He faked a public key signing
He has a well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related (see numbers 88 through 102)
His own mother admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
He is not technically competent in the subject matter
His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's
He called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space
He actively bought and traded coins from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
He was paid millions for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive

No, and he appears to be loath to talk about it. I'd be interested to hear both of their current opinions, though, just for curiosity's sake. 
Yes, Ian Grigg appears to be one of the very few who think he's Satoshi. Do you know if he still holds that opinion? 

Look at you and what you spend your time doing.

Spreading the truth about an obvious fraud and liar? 
Calling out sockpuppets like you? 
Contributing to electron cash?
Clarifying technical discussions?

It would be good if both sides stopped attacking the people and instead debated the ideas.

Ironic. When was Craig right and Peter wrong? Let's talk about the ideas.
I'll stop pointing out how much of a fraud he is when he stops showing up on the front page of this sub nearly every day. He is bad for the value of my BCH.

Resorting to vote brigading and going all in with your socks

LOL. Solid projection, /u/williaminlondon. And why is my comment in the negative if I'm vote brigading? Solid logic.

Such a tool you are!

Please let the adults talk. Petty insults are not helpful. 
I agree completely!! Good thing somebody already did it. 

has sponsored several BCH startups, what has Rick done? What really worries me though is that you speak as someone indoctrinated in the cult of Pirate Rick. Pirate Rick can be wrong too and he is dead wrong about CSW. Your only counter argument is "because Pirate Rick said", you sound like a brainwashed idiot who cannot think for himself but regurgitates whatever "Pirate Rick" says.

/u/Falkvinge, the nChain narrative against you seems to have begun. Expect /u/btcnewsupdates et al. to start the attacks as well. 
Go away, troll. 
Sorry, did you actually read any of that 'debunking'? That garbage was itself debunked here in that very thread.
If it's all 'debunked', just explain this one thing: the fake blog post. I'll wait.

Contrarian's "actual evidence" once everything else has been debunked

Let's try just one, then. Try debunking this fake blog post from Craig. I'll wait.
I'm not sure if you're familiar with how patent trolling works. It doesn't even matter if the 'invention' is real, useful, or new. We have no reason to think nChain has good intentions here.
The plan was:

The plan was always clear to the men behind nCrypt. They would bring Wright to London and set up a research and development centre for him, with around thirty staff working under him. They would complete the work on his inventions and patent applications – he appeared to have hundreds of them – and the whole lot would be sold as the work of Satoshi Nakamoto, who would be unmasked as part of the project. Once packaged, Matthews and MacGregor planned to sell the intellectual property for upwards of a billion dollars. MacGregor later told me he was speaking to Google and Uber, as well as to a number of Swiss banks. ‘The plan was to package it all up and sell it,’ Matthews told me. ‘The plan was never to operate it.’

The funny thing with Craig is that he takes credit for others' successes (Satoshi, Liu and Wang, etc.), but when there's an undeniable fault, he immediately blames others. 
Is anyone surprised by this? 
How dare you speak, even obliquely, against Saint Craig the Misunderstood? Don't you see? He's protecting BCH against, um, something. You wouldn't understand! You are clearly a Blockstream and/or Bitcoin Unlimited troll hellbent on sowing seeds of discord, just like the famous BCH-haters Peter Rizun, Amaury Sechet, and Vitalk Buterin. 

When I have time, I will try to explain why the SM paper is wrong in laymans terms

LOL. 
This is impressive hypocrisy. I invite everyone to check out our respective reddit histories. I've been posting about bitcoin for at least the past 4 years. Meanwhile, /u/geekmonk has been shilling random cryptos and other strange deals for a long time. There are dozens of examples in his history of this behavior. 
So, who is more likely to be a shill?

By the way, it's easy to mess with Internet archives...if you know how. 

Lol. Yes, please tell me another story. This unfalsifiable narrative is so compelling!

how can proof be plagiarized? Proofs are proofs, they prove something.

You said "he proved" here. "In the paper, he proves a theorem"

Bitcoin has been approximated to a Poisson process. Nonetheless, even in the ideal case without difficult changes or a hash rate growth, it is better represented using a negative binomial or Erlang distribution. Reacting to the distribution of a block makes the distribution conditional. The selfish miner acts after the honest miner; thus, it is no longer an i.i.d. Poisson process.

...

Revenue is not profit; however, even in this instance, we demonstrated that the overall rates of revenue are lowered and therefore no rational, profit-seeking miner would engage in such a strategy.

Where is the mathematical proof of this? Isn't that what this post is about? The mathematics of the paper? His 'revenue' claims aren't backed up by any math.
Which part about DK wasn't proven fake? We know the 'contracts' between Craig and Dave were faked. My point is that there's no evidence that's not directly connected to Craig that Dave had any involvement with bitcoin. 
OK, I'll accept that there's some evidence that he heard of bitcoin. This certainly doesn't rise to the level of 'involvement', though.
I look forward to your next ‘mea culpa’ post about this. 

When all it says is the time stamps were removed. 

It does not say this. Read it again. 
Here is code I just wrote that follows the algorithm described in the paper. Alpha represents the selfish miner proportion of the hashpower. Change it to whatever you want. You'll see that if it's above 0.33 (33%), they'll get MORE THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE OF BLOCKS!!! 
If it's less than 0.33, they'll get LESS THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE.
This is what is described in the paper and what Craig denies. 
I’m an equal opportunity sock puppet denouncer. 
Who cares?
