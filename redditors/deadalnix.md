You also have plenty of advantages as a foreigner. Basicly, you are playing in god mode.

First, you have a conversation starter: you are new here and try to meet people.
Second, you have a different culture and learning the local culture or explaining your own make for good conversation.
Third, people don't expect you to be as sharp as a local when it comes to language and alike. You are a foreigner, they are forgiving and don't expect subtle playwords.
Finally, foreign is intriguing and generally sexy.

Peter Todd values responsiple disclosure quite a bit. This is why he shouted about bu's vulns on twitter immeditely after discovery.
Protecting the name is a trademark issue, not a copyright one. There is nothing the license can do about this.
My bet is markov chain + neural net + a large training set.
I don't know, has bitmain and ViaBTC said they will bankrupt everyone, burn it all to the ground and double spend exchanges, censored their critics, announce they'll steal coins when people use them in way they don't like and want to get rid of permisionless innovation ?
There is a vulnerability that has been disclosed at Breaking Bitcoin. BitClub is trying to exploit it. The last version of Bitcoin ABC is not vulnerable to the attack, so upgrading is probably a good idea.

Yeah to JJ for responsibly disclosing the attack.
Booh to BitClub for playing stupid games. 
American women are not very attractive, and have very high expectations.
There is a saying in France: "il ne faut pas prendre les clients pour des cons, mais ne pas oublier qu'ils en sont". Which translate roughly as don't treat your customers like morrons, but do not forget that they are.
Drama. A lot of drama.
There is zero content and no proposal. What are we discussing here ?
Ethereum is having proplems, therefore, we must do what ethereum is doing.
I do not make price prediction. But let me explain you something.

Companies, such as mining companies have obligations. In economics, an obligation is something you have not paid yet, but you know you will have to pay in the future. For instance, the salary of your staff, or the electricity bill.

As the price go down, the amount they need to sell increase to pay their obligations. This makes crypto a very bizare thing to trade, the supply curve slope has the wrong direction. For instance, when the price of oil decrease, people stop drilling oil and supply diminishes. But for crypto, when the price go down, the supply increase because companies have to sell more to cover their obligations.

This tends to create an amplification effect. When price go down, supply increase, and price go down even more. When price go up, supply decreases and the price go up even more. This is why we see the kind of violent swing in price we see.

So, considering this, what causes reversals ? In the case of the bear market, what causes the reversal is enough companies going under so that the amount sold due to obligations is supported by the demand.

We know this process is ongoing as many miners went under recently - we can see a pretty big hashrate drop over the past few weeks. We also see many companies going bankrupt or downsizing. When do we know enough downsizing has taken place ? Your guess is as good as mine. As a reference point, last time this happened, people did commit suicide and we haven't reached that point yet - however, price drop has been more severe, so maybe the make up of the crowd evolved somewhat and is less suicide prone.

In any case, the important question is how do we stop that crazy cycle and bring some stability ? First, we stay tempered during the hype cycle. The hype of last year caused many to launch project in crypto, many of them bad projects. These projects are now selling the money they collected last year and are part of the reason we have a bear market. In economics, we call this malinvestment. Reducing the malinvestment in the bull market will reduce the violence of the bear market. Second, we grow usage. As a matter of fact, usage of crypto has a proper supply curve - people spend more when they are richer, so it is  stabilizing force on the market. Making sure the amount of money sold due to usage is greater than the amount of money spent due to obligations is the key to ensuring a stable price for crypto.
Welcome onboard :)
Giving everybody the same tax evasion capabilities that the powerful have, this is progress. Where are the SJW ?
John Carmack is a very well know game developer. He made the first first person shooter (wolfenstein) and doom, that had such a big impact that FPS were used to be called doom-like games.

The technology he made for id software games has been reused in many other title, including very famous half life and counter strike.

He publish most of id source code when newer technology is available, allowing many younger developer to learn how video game are done.

His code source is recognized by other developers as being very well designed, high quality, high performance code. He is known for popularizing several techniques (Quake3 network system, Rage's megatexture technology, and many others).

He is now knowing to work on virtual reality device http://www.gametrailers.com/videos/ibyv7z/doom-3-bfg-edition-virtual-reality-interview

TL;DR : He created many technology used in video games, provided a lot of material for people to learn how to do video games, and invented a whole video game genre. He should have been in the top10.
I'm always surprized how many programmers think they are good because they made code that works. That's the bare minimum (not average as mentionned in the article). If you can't make code that works, you are not a programmer, period.

If you can make code that works, the only thing you've proven is that you are the level 0 of programmer.
While accurate, this is also kind of too nice. The reason ABC took the lead is because BU and XT were stuck on various aspects of the spec and I realized, that they wouldn't ship in time. So I trashed all my work on extension blocks - which is what the ABC codebase was built for to begin with, even though it did not have that name at the time we started to work on the fork. I was able to convince you to follow in that crazy adventure.
Yes. You are missing that

1/ Math tells us gamma cannot possibly be negative (that would require someone putting negative hashrate on the network, which makes zero sense).

2/ Physics tells us that gamma cannot even be zero (That would require faster than light communication and infallible hardware).

3/ That even with gamma = 0 (which we established is impossible) selfish mining still works.

Sorry, nothing in this blog post shows vitalik wrong. At best it demonstrate that the author doesn't understand the math behind selfish mining.
I can already experience this, and I'm not even half as famous as roger is, so I can imagine.
Sending the message to autority that they can shit on you without consequences lol is rarely a good idea.
I don't think we should rejoice about these kind of attacks.
You are confused. This is a male power fantaisy, and obviously a proof that patriarchy is damaging society, especially young girls. Also, rape culture, so check your privilege.

op_datasigverify is very likely. The proposal still has some rough edges but itis self contained and everybody wants it so it's pretty much a given.

There will be few changes that are fairly technical, not very visible to users but will allow to scale further in the future, such as improvement to the mining api or new block propagation techniques such as graphene.

Probably no more block size increase in the next few month as it require more infrastructure work for it to work well.

There will probably be changes in the fee structure as well, to ensure common use cases are even cheaper while abusive behavior remain expensive.
So far, I'm more like [Cassandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra).
We need to defend our values fiercely and unapologetically.

But most importantly, break free of petty fight with the "other camp" and build our thing. Fighting is a high cost/low reward activity. We need to focus on building again.
Core is the implementation that benefit from the censorship on the other subreddit. They are subverting bitcoin as digital cash to transform it into a settlement layer. See https://medium.com/@jgarzik/bitcoin-is-being-hot-wired-for-settlement-a5beb1df223a

They used various bully tactics to get rid of historical devs who do not support their vision such as Gavin.

Bitcoin Unlimited and Classic are other implement which are trying to put Bitcoin back on track with the original vision.
They don't want the idea that blockstream took over core and is now in control of it to be too well known, so they insist on making the difference between the 2.
Branding is very important. Most Free software participant do not realize this. User like familiarity. This is a very positive change indeed.
I would not encourage to go all in, whatever the investment decision. I hope it'll pan out for you :)

It doesn't speak highly of him and binance.

But what's worse, is that he and binance are still doing better than most, who still support BSV. Hey gap600. Hola BU. Bonjour blockchair. Hallo poloniex. Ohaiyo coinify. Hej SBI. Buongiorno deconomy.
Funny how the fakable metrics say segwit has support, but the trustworthy ones - work or stake - say the opposite...   
Only if the program is 1Gb.
No, this happens on a regular basis. Every time, the end result is the same.
Nobody lives outside of the us, it is a well known fact.
Anything at Facebook is big. If a feature is used by only 1% of the users, it is used by 20M users. As a result, all the systems at Facebook need to be scalable from day 1.

Working at such company provide an experience scaling system that very few other workplaces can provide. It'd be a shame to not apply this experience to Bitcoin Cash.
Greg accused ABC of violating core's copyright. Someone looked into it and found out that no, ABC doesn't violate core's copyright, however, core violated the copyright from satoshi and other early contributors.
100% on point. Nothing to add.
At 1MB per 10mins, or even 2MB per 10 mins, we are no threat to anyone. We are just little nerds who think they are doing something because they don't realize how big the world is.
These people are about asserting power. The morality rhetoric is just an excuse to do so.
The equation is wrong. It is Price(BCC) / Difficulty(BCC) == Price(BTC) / Difficulty(BTC) that we want to reach.

Except that, you are 100% on point.
The new narrative is that Calvin created Bitcoin Cash.

The only promise on which they were able to deliver is bankrupting everybody.
The idea of SegWit2x, while far from my favorite choice, would be something I'd be ready to settle for if done right. However, the current proposal is not done right for several reasons.

First and foremost, it fails to interlock segwit and the HF. This create an opportunity to bait and switch after segwit activates, and several market actors already hinted that they want to do so. This is bad. This is amplified by the fact that most major big block clients (classic, BU) do not support SegWit, so the big block camp will have very little leverage when it is needed as it will be busy catching up with SegWit.

Second, because the team is reproducing the mistakes made by core early on: letting the crazy getting onboard and going along with them. James Hillard was able to influence the spec in some very meaningful way . See https://github.com/btc1/bitcoin/pull/21 for reference. James abused his position at BitClub to attack the network not so long ago (see https://medium.com/@bithernet/bitclub-why-are-you-doing-malleability-attack-now-6faa194b2146) which tells us that this person is ready to cause damage and be deceitful to achieve his goals. Because the new btc1 structure has the same weaknesses as core, we can safely assume that the end game will be similar.

Given the reasons above, I'm highly skeptical of the current SegWit2x movement and I cannot in good conscience support it. Even if it work, because of point 2, we have a very high risk of ending up in the same position we are now in a few years.
I know it is ironical, but let me still answer this seriously. I work for one of these web giant companies. Needless to say we have scalling problem that are way bigger than bitcoin has now, and if a team of 5 couldn't handle more than 3tps on their system after few month of dev, they'd be fired. But back on the subject.

One does not look at the average workload to do scaling. One look at peak usage. That is why you can use amazon before christmas, you can use facebook during the superbowl and you can use google map when everybody go in vacation.

If any of these systems try the come back later card, they'd be quickly replaced. And so will bitcoin if the block limit remains.
It can be you.
The fact that it breaks all abstraction boundaries is very much a reason to chose to look for alternatives.
Stop caring about them. Build the alternative. If they are as bad as you think they are, you got nothing to worry about.
It improve on two aspects. The first one is block propagation. Ordering information is the bulk of the information being transmitted. For instance, it is more than 80% of the data used by graphene.

The second reason is that for scaling, you need to be able to split the work required in chunk that are mostly independent of each others, so that different core or at larger scale different server can process one chunk. The current ordering rules, known as topological ordering, do not lend themselves to be checked in individual chunks easily and so makes scaling significantly more difficult as a result.
Honestly, I spent most of my time with Vin, Roger, Ryan and a few other. I spent less than a minute with Craig. So I don't have much to say.
I know, but still worth mentioning, IMO.
Self made man is not anti feminist in the sense it doesn't say diectly much about feminism. However, her finding in the book contradict many core tenants of feminism.

The other ones are busy working.
Che killed thousands, Musk made online payement, electric cars and rockets. That is indeed completely comparable.
This format isn't bech32 . It is based on prior work by Rusty Russel, that also served as a base for bech32.
Major reorg and network split, because segwit nodes aren't accepting blocks from non segwit nodes. As a result, they may not recieve the block at all and 2 chain start to build, until reorg happens.

That would create a terrible user experience and would cost miners a ton of money if done on main net. 
It was 20M, then 8, then 2-4-8, then just 2, then just 2 after SegWit during the summer and now the summer is passed and nothing happened.

Don't be fooled. The time for finding a middle ground has passed.
What the hell dude !

Thanks a lot. That's a lot !
The confirmation time is misleading. One ether confirmation is really not the same thing as one btc confirmation.

When you reduce the block time, you decrease the PoW that go into each block, and the confirmation is insecure by that much.

In addition, faster blocks means higher orphan rate, so more wasted PoW, so less overall security.

Not that what ethereum does is bad, but if you are going to compare, compare everything.
That's how you know it never was about CTOR or CDS.
I've been around in that sub since 2012 or so.
They are working on it, but moving a business from supporting one coin to supporting several is a lot of work.

This is not new. People oppsing the Clintons have a tendancies to have accidents at a disturbingly high rate.
They have been saying this for more than a year. It's just a way to delay and get you to eat the SegWit pill.
They have the same investors as blockstream.
No, they say they wouldn't date someone like this. That is not shaming.
Vin Armani, mengerian an myself were beating that drum for many month.
If CSW really think this is a superior approach, then he should compete on the open market by creating his own fork. However, I suspect it isn't and I suspect he also knows it isn't, because he is not trying to compete on the market.

Bitcoin SV right now is clearly not ready and we are 2 month before the fork. Their pool is not launched, their software not released, there is no testnet, the seeder doesn't work, and there is more. So on a technical level, I'm not impressed. It looks more of a PR stunt to me than an actual engineering effort.
Half of that is promise that may never be delivered (remember somethign big was coming in January ?) the other half wasn't done by CSW.
HAHA. Alright.

I never quite know what to answer to these kind of thread. 
Ad hominem and no arguments, it looks like you are the desperate one.
But Bernie is definitively going to do it. It will cost $500 in taxes and save $5000 to the tax payer. Contrary to nigerian scam, this 100% true. Bernie would never lie.
I suspect this is staged. There has been a ton of BU nodes spinned in February. I suspect someone unplugged most of them a once to make BU look bad.
No it wouldn't crash the whole network, because crashing node do not propagate blocks very well. Still pretty bad.
No because he stormed out the first day in the morning, and did not show up the second day. Vitalik showed up at the venue the second day, but did not attend the meeting.
If you want a crypto with no devs, I'd suggest litecoin.
Author is a bit too much convinced that ownership is easy to use and solve all problems. However, it is taxing on the API, when GC is not, and can become very complex in some situation (ie a graph of object with varying lifetime for instance, will be horrible).

GC is certainly not perfect, but it has the nice property of being safe, non taxing on API and good enough in most cases.

Granted, D's GC is not really good right now, and D would benefit greatly improving it. But there is a vast body of evidence right now that show that it can be done.

The truth here is that there is no silver bullet. The problem has been on the table for a long time and we now have various solutions, all with pro and cons, and anyone that tell you that one is superior to the other without precisely framing the context in which this statement applies has something to sell you rather than some technical point to make.
Thanks to you.
The community will have to push back strongly against people who try to move Bitcoin Cash in an undesirable direction. I think people such as Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik made the mistake of not being protective enough of the values of the project and it ended up being hijacked. We need to learn from this mistake and not reproduce it.

Bitcoin Cash's anonymity is not ideal, but hopefully low fees will allow users to use mixers again. And maybe the process of using them should be automated in various wallet's UI. Some coins offers higher anonymity, such as monero, but they also make more security assumption, so there is a higher risk of one of these assumption ending up in a catastrophic failure of the system.
Note, the world is not responsible if the US has shit overpriced internet.

In most of Europe and eastern asia, you'll get at least 20Mbps for much cheaper.

In France for instance, you get for 40€/month a fiber connexion (100Mbps up and down) or VDSL2 if fiber is not available where you live (50 to 100Mbps depending on the quality of your line). This come with TV, free unlimited phone call, including international, an apple TV like device - you can even torrent with it :) . Check it out : http://free.fr Don't need all this and only want a cheap internet line ? OVH has you covered for 25€ a month for 28 to 92Mbps depending on your line.

But that's just France. You want some real killer, go to Romania. You'll get 150Mbps for 7.5€/month or 500Mbps for about 10€/month with UPC.

The world has moved without waiting for Vericast and Comzon to get their shit in order.
You misspelled "facts".
Yup, that is what makes me mad. Javascript is crap and we are stuck with it in the browser. But Node.js is just spreading the cancer. And there is a crowd of dev out there for who it isn't enough. From firefox os to gnome extension, javascript must be everywhere.

On a side note , I maintaing a fairly popular gnome extension, and got the npm crowd wanting to string it with the whole crazy mess. I'm glad I said no. I feel dirty enough using javascript there.
I'll let you judge. What about taking a concrete example such as https://reviews.bitcoinabc.org/D1194

As you can see, the change set went through 9 iterations, at the end of which, the code was still bogus, but the tests were bogus as well so they managed to miss it. At the end, I ended having to write https://reviews.bitcoinabc.org/D1231 .

nChain's intervention about the opcodes was an unmitigated disaster and Shay, Jason and myself has to make it all work while traveling. Not only nChain was unable to deliver, but they created a significant amount of overhead for us to review broken patches after broken patches. Their impact on that one was undoubtedly negative.
Sad, but likely the case.
You are reading this correctly.

"Your money is my money if you do something I disapprove of".
Vitalik did not attend the meeting, but met with various people outside.

Not sure what you are referring to for Defcon. Did you mean deconomy ? If so, he was correct to point out that CSW spouted complete nonsense.
If people want to do L2 solution on top of BCC, then so be it. I have nothing against L2 per se, but I think some important points have been ignored. First L2 can only be as reliable as L1 is. When block become congested and L1 become unreliable, L2 does so as well. Second, L2 will have different characteristics than L1. For some use case, this will be better, and that's great. For other, L2 is worse. There is no silver bullet here, so thinking we'll push everything into L2 is not a realistic roadmap.

Finally, L2 needs to provide additional value to be worth doing. The only way we'll know if that's the case is by letting them compete fairly against L1. Crippling L1 to incentivize L2 is an exceptionally bad idea.
Bitmain is funded by bitcoin, blockstream by fiat. That's all you need to know.
Please don't give him more attention.
These are the developments I'm the most exited about as well.
You should write an article on honest.cash or alike about this. This is very interesting.

And who would have guessed? Science works!
They do, 10:1 . As it should be.
> Do you agree with /r/btc's moderation policies? Do you believe that harsher anti-trolling policies would be beneficial for the community, or do you think that would harm more than help?

I think /r/btc policies are a bit lax, but on the other hand, the community was abused by outrageaous moderation policies from /r/bitcoin, so it's understandable. Finding proper policies is difficult.

> What do you see as the biggest hurdle(s) to mainstream adoption?

I think there are two main axes:

1/ Most of the ecosystem is highly unprofessional and constantly playing petty games. It is important to come up with a roadmap well in advance, a schedule that goes with it and stick to it. Not doing so will cause a lot of incertitude in the market and why would you build your product on top of a plateform that will evolve in unspecified ways in the future ?

2/ UX. Let's be honest, UX is not great right now. Many basic tasks are stupidly complex to execute. For instance, transferring money from a wallet on a computer such as electron cash to a mobile wallet require you to type the address manually reading it on your phone's screen, or finding a way to send that address to yourself, for instance by mail. This is bad.

> Following up on the above, Monero is a very well respected and well liked crypto in this community. Do you interact at all with their development team. Do you believe there are lessons we can learn from their development practices, especially surrounding hard forks? What, if any, features of Monero do you believe Bitcoin Cash should adopt?

I do not interact with their team much. They are overall very professional, and I wish the BCH ecosystem would learn from it. In term of feature however, not that much. The UX with monero is atrocious - connecting your wallet in command line to your node is not something most people I know are going to be willing to do - and on a technical perspective they made tradeoff that increase privacy but also make it significantly harder to scale, which is not a tradeoff that make sense for Bitcoin Cash.

> And lastly, we've seen already that the best way to attack crypto is through social engineering, not technical flaws in the protocol or network. Do you think there are some superior governance techniques Bitcoin Cash can use to protect itself from such attacks, both ongoing and future?

The Bitcoin Cash immune system is very weak on that front. I'm not worried about government that much because there are more immediate threats from within already. If that doesn't improve, good people are going to be weeded out. It already happened for some.
Privacy is a human right and you can bet the BCH community will work toward making it more and more private, regardless of what twitter celebrities think of it.
Ethereum stand on its own ground and created a tremendous amount of value. You may be interested in what it is doing or not, up to you, but trashing it is very poor style.
Indeed, if you redefine gamma AND redefined what negative means, then craig is right.

However, "negative gamma" only contains two words, and, as a result, having to redefine two to be right is not exactly a stellar performance.

And even though the article claim that would make it right, it still doesn't, but we don't even need to get there, because that thing is a fractal of errors. Getting to them all is a gigantic waste of time. One could qualify this as a DoS attack on the scientific community in the crypto space.
You understand everything correctly.
I think stupid for the most part. Blockstream is lead by people who claim expertise. But if they were, would they have dismissed the idea to begin with ?
Quick note on reverse engineering the chip. It is doable. Not all transitors are 16nm, power line for instance aren't. It is also posible to analyse structures to detect what is register or compute units or data/power lines. Then it is possible to zoom in the areas of interest.

Doing so is frequent in the chip business, both to detect and analyse defects in one's own chips or to checkout what competition is doing. However, doing so is no small feat.

See for instance what the guys at nVidia are doing: https://youtu.be/pRz_CG3DZb4

It require highly specialized devices that cost millions. It also require specialized skills that gmax do not have, and nobody at blockstream has either. 
There is always a line going through 2 data points...
For men, horny is rape.
Sure, this is who Greg is.

Sure as Well, Roger did fuck up. Numerous people went to Roger over the course of the year. I did several times. Once I told him his support for CSW would be his MtGOX moment. Some extremely talented people decided to leave the ecosystem, after reaching to Roger and not getting any result from it. They saw leadership unable to differenciate talent from bullshit so, honestly, I cannot blame them.

Forget about gmax. CSW could not have damaged BCH to the extent he was able to if numerous community members did not enable him. We must expect these people to adjust their behavior or move on without them. And if that means Roger, that means Roger. I wish it never has to come to this.

BCH cannot continue to blame all the problems it has on blockstream/CSW/theymos/whatever. It's not healthy. The first step toward growth is recognizing where one fucked up and address it.

I fucked up by not opposing CSW more loudly, by trying to accomodate with people who seeked to weaken BCH in the hopes they could be top dog and these who would be overly trusting. I will not makes these mistakes again.
Ryan is a liar, I think this was etablished by now.
Hi. If you want to donate, please do so using the address on https://www.bitcoinabc.org/ . That's more useful than donating to me.
Because nobody ever asked for it. Everybody think that everybody else wants it but nobody really do. 
That's correct but that's not what the quadratic hashing problem is.

A block can contain more sigops with SegWit and with bigger blocks. This is not scaling, this is capacity increase. Scaling is how much more resource do you need to process theses.

If the scaling is quadratic, you need 4 time more resources to process twice as many sigops.
If the scaling is linear, you need twice as many resources to process twice as many sigops.

In the case of SegWit, you can have much more sigops in a block, which is the result of the capacity increase. But how much more expensive these sigops are ?

Well, it depends on the transaction size. If you use the extra capacity to put more transaction in, scaling is linear in both cases. This is why BU is keeping a limit on the transaction size, but not on the block size.

If you use the extra capacity to make bigger transaction, then scaling is quadratic without SegWit and can be either quadratic or linear, depending on the transaction with SegWit.
Listen, we are going to reason and it's gonna be great. It's going to be terrific. There will be so much reason you won't believe it. A tremendous amount of reason, I tell you !
Traffic on water is VERY regulated, and the regulation is enforced in a city like Amsterdam.
> That said I've been very critical of the way ABC acts with their upgrade proposals which leave zero room for discussions

To the contrary, we published timeline so that discussion would happen in a way that wouldn't be disruptive. The feature freeze was set Aug, 15. Bitcoin SV was announced Aug, 16.

I'm sorry but it is not possible to change everything at the last minute. It has nothing to do with being inflexible, but we have an ecosystem to support. No objection was formulated within the proper timeframe, and, to be 100% the objection formulated after that are mostly of the kind it's contentious (because we make it so).

The current upgrade contains numerous elements requested by 3rd parties - the same 3rd parties that try to paint ABC as inflexible and dictatorial now. Notably OP_CHECKDATASIG is nothing more than Andrew Stone's OP_DSV  after going through review and integrating feedback (You can subsequently verify that Andrew voted against OP_CDS to be implemented in BU). The malleability flags were a request from Tom harding (more specifically he asked for 4 of them, but only 2 could be implemented and tested properly in the timeframe we had). In fact, going full CTOR was a also a request from Tom Harding, ABC only proposed to remove TTOR and allow any ordering in Nov. nChain used to support these changes and you can find documents on their website in favor of both CTOR and OP_CHECKDATASIG from several month back.

It is simply not possible to cooperate productively if people are going to request things and then shoot you down when you do what they asked.

The most disappointing part in all of this is that this drama attract a ton of attention on actors that behave poorly, to the detriment of the ones doing the actual hard work. bitprim has been cooperating with ABC very nicely, has setup testnet for all the upgrades, including the initial one that created BCH. They've provided infrastructure for wallet, block explorer and various other services. They also implement their own node software. But you know what they aren't doing ? I think you do, and this why you haven't heard of them as often as other I mention in that post.

In any case, we are open for discussion about what should happen in May next year. The time to have this discussion is now. If you have something of interest to be included by then, I suggest you to get involved now. Join the workgroups, write a proposal for a spec, you'll discover that we are open for discussion. Provide feedback on ABC's proposals - we are desperate to get more. But if the plan is to not do so, and then complain in March that ABC is inflexible then yes, ABC will be inflexible. The feature freeze date for Next May will be Feb, 15. It'll come fast, so now is the time to get to work.
What aboout bitcoin being hot wired to deploy patented tech instead ? Maybe it is something you want to address ?
I know, it's a ton of work to get a spec in shape. But it's kind of my point. There are always many people yelling at these who shovel the dirt that not enough dirt is shoveled, but not many to actualy shovel the dirt.

I do agree with you that having a spec is important. Idealy for all the existing, but especialy for what's proposed as addition.

Still I think the point I was making stands. The ratio between noise made and social media and work actualy done by our community is far from ideal.
There are very many of them. Most people in the space arrived after 2015 and never knew of time before the split.
They don't understand it is a threat to their ideology as much as it is a threat to the institution they despise.
No
Because they invited me and this is a sub I like and frequent, so I said yes.
I think it is up to funders to chose to disclose this or not, not me.

Bitcoin.com is funding us publicly by sending a small amount of the coinbase reward of every block they mine to us. For other people, it's not my place to say.
I'm most exited by product that give an opportunity to use BCH as money.

Services like https://www.cheapair.com/ or https://destinia.co.uk/ for traveling, https://purse.io/ to get discount on amazon, and so on.
This is in fact, the only reason abc exist in the first place.
There is an important difference: there will be no bail out.
Can you remind me, was the original paper was titled "Bitcoin: a peer to peer electronic cash system", or "Bitcoin: a currency that is sometime quite attractive to use without making a new blockchain transaction" ? I don't quite remember.
He is right. LN works by exchanging IOU rather than the currency itself, and this is how it can operate off chain.

LN is better than banks in various way, notably because you can't do fractional banking - at least not with current proposals. But deep down, LN IS banking.

Another reason LN will be very much like banks is that nodes need to be VERY rich. For instance, if you want to support payment up to X, you need to have at least X locked in a channel with every users. For instance, if you want to serve 1000 users and allow payments up to $100 (which is pretty small both as an amount and as a number of users, all thing considered) you already need $100 000 locked in channel with your users. You then need to lock larger amount in channel in between nodes to ensure that the network run smoothly.

And this scales very poorly. Consider you want to serve a million users and allow payments up to $1000 (we are very far from a world scale currency here) you need a freaking billion dollar just to lock in the channels with you users. This kind of amount is out of reach to pretty much anyone who isn't already running the financial system or satoshi himself.
There are 2 transactions in there with 31k outputs that are perfectly consistent with an attempt to exploit the vulnerability presented by JJ.

Video requires hundreds of kilobyte per second of bandwidth, which no computer can handle today. Computer can barely handle 1Mb every 10 minutes. Better stick with a transcript.

I mean the transcript is already more than 12kb, and can't be loaded on a PDP8 !
LN doesn't work without it.
A 10% swing used to be a daily occurence. Don't read too much into it.
I never really pushed wormhole forward. Bitcoin Cash is permissionless and the wormhole team is free to build whatever they like on top of it. I think it's great that people build things on top of Bitcoin Cash, be it Wormhole, Counterparty Cash or anything else. Usefulness and scarcity is what gives BCH (or anything else, really) its value so it's a good sign that people want to use it.

The whole story has no leg to stand on and is being manufactured to smear existing actors in the space.
BTC has 10 time the hashpower BCH has. If hashpower solely determine consensus, then what are you doing here ?
CSW is threatening everybody who fork to go patent troll on them. Blookstream never went that far. Remove your blinders.

It's rather simple. Tom banned me from classic's slack and excluded himself from ABC's and now go on tour on social media being surprised that he is out of the loop. Go figure...
I think you mean Peter Todd. He was very pissed because he attach a great importance to responsible disclosure. For instance, when he learned about the BU bug in XThin, he chose to work closely with the BU team instead of blasting it on twitter.

Oh wait... http://archive.is/Lc6uK
The very high level roadmap is becoming cash. That means we need to improve 0-conf and increase capacity quite dramatically. Pre-consensus technologies seems to be the most promising road to me. We also need to rework the innards of the client so that it can handle much larger volumes.

Working with other group is something we wanted to do with Bitcoin Cash since the beginning. Bitcoin Cash is the child of Bitmain's contingency plan for UAHF and BUIP055 from BU. Most of the discussion about the spec happened in BU's channels and was done closely with several BU members. Having several implementation will avoid one of them going rogue - as the market can switch to another one - and also increases resilience, as they will have different bugs.
Not surprising. Mention 1MB per 10mins to a Facebook or Google eng, the response you get is incredulity. Past that, total disinterest.
4Mb doesn't fit on a floppy disk anymore ! We can't go there !
The mechanism for consensus is simple. Say everybody who disagree with you is a troll and ban them. See, everyone agrees now !

It's great to see. Well done guys. Everybody got what they wanted with that fork and it is to be celebrated.
I'm sorry you did not get the memo. BCH is about being digital cash, not CSW's pet project. If nChain wants to do something else, maybe they should try to start their own coin and see how it goes.
No it is worse. First you need a spend all tx in the legacy block + witness data. That means less effiscient use of space. Because of the way thing are structured, nodes have to be ready to absorb a block up to 4Mb large, but in practice, only the equivalent of 1.7Mb are available to users.

Even if you put asside the central planning aspect of it, that is a very poor solution compared to growing the block size.
No. First it is not a survey it is data mining user behavior on the site (which is more accurate than a survey). Second, this is consistenly found on other dating sites like Tinder and a full body of comportemental studies. In fact, this can be shown to also be true for other great apes like chimps or gorillas.

Not v0.18.1, but 0.18.2 probably will. Bitcoin ABC has a strategy that is a bit different from BU on that front  and I think that is better for Bitcoin Cash long term. We focused on bottlenecks that may not be the one that hit first, but the one that are harder to change. The reason is that they will only become harder and harder to change as time goes by.

Right now, both ABC and BU can handle two orders of magnitude more than market demand, so we are good on that front.

Bitmain isn't your enemy. People voluntary buy ASIC from them because they think these ASICs are good. The ASICboost controversy is fabricated (SegWit doesn't block ASICboost) and this one is as well.

While I agree with you in general, that there is a bit of group think in here, don't be fooled. This is a smear campaign against Bitmain because they do support big blocks, nothing else.

Not really? If anything he makes the story of CSW more sensible, but on the other hand, none of them provided any proof of anything. In the end, it really doesn't matter what they did or did not do in the past as it doesn't inform us on the present.

Because the number you are presented are not accurate. You can produce a 4MB block, but it doesn't fit common usage pattern. More realistically, if segwit get 100% adoption, you'll get about 1.7x block size increase.

Now, mind you, you get the benefit when you SPEND segwit coins, not when you create them. So you need one transaction for most UTXO to segwit outputs - with 0 benefit, and then you get benefits. Realistically, it's going to take several month to get anywhere close to the 1.7x number.
In 5 years, I hope we will have made progress on "pre-consensus". Pre-consensus is a set of techniques that allows the network to build a block over time rather than miner anoncing something completely new every 10 minutes on average. A lot of work has been made in that area, but sadly, not much has been used in production at scale. I think at subchains, weak block or Bitcoin NG for instance. I think this is a priority because it both allows for bigger blocks, as most of the validation work can happen before the block is created rather than after, but also increases the security of 0-conf transaction.

I see Bitcoin Cash as a huge success so far. It is about one month old now, and has reached the 3rd place in term of market cap. Many wallets and exchanges are now supporting it as well. By most metrics, this is the most successful launch of a coin, ever.

Maxwell did not pester me in private channels. He clearly stated to me that he don't wanted to talk to me outside of a courtroom, and, while he seems to have a hard time to maintain this stance in public places like reddit, he is sticking to it in private channels.
Because of the way the difficulty adjustment works on the Bitcoin chain, it makes it very unlikely that it survive being a minority chain. As a result, it is unlikely that this chain will survive if Bitcoin Cash gets a lot of traction. As long as Bitcoin Cash is a minority chain, both chain will continue to live.

I don't think there should be a reference client any more than there is a reference browser on the web. However, having several clients require cooperation, and the problem is, several client are not very cooperative. Bitcoin ABC has included many feature desired by 3rd parties in its releases, for instance, CheckDataSig and the opcodes enabled in May. However, it is only possible to cooperate with parties that wish to cooperate.
Transaction are non standard, so only a miner can decide to include them.
I'm so disappointed by the leader in this ecosystem. They all saw the problem, and they all caved in.
/r/bitcoin is heavily censored. because of this the position there has been more and more detached from reality over time.

The good news is, if everybody produce block that take 40 minutes to propagate, then the network do not converge anymore, and everybody get its own coin, even if consensus rules are compatible.
I don't think Craig understand the inner working, and I don't think he cares.
The big blocker lost the BTC ticker because they were very unstrategic during the whole battle. When SW2X happened, I knew big block on BTC was not going to happen and I started the effort to make a minority chain happen.

I'd rather focus on making Bitcoin Cash more valuable rather than fight over which is the true Bitcoin. Claiming to be the true Bitcoin do not bring any value to users. Incidentaly, if Bitcoin Cash become more valluable than Bitcoin, then it's just a matter of time before its chain becomes longer than BTC and remove any doubt about which is Bitcoin.

The current 64MB block is now more than 40 minutes old and still hasn't propagated completely to the network. Which is what Chris warned about. It aged very well.
Let me have a stab at it. It is easier to validate TTOR in a single threaded manner. In fact, this is the most likely reason it is in the software in the first place. There is literally no code that checks TTOR at the moment, no mention of it anywhere in the codebase or satoshi's writing or the writing of any other early designer of the system as far as I know.

The most likely reason it exists is also an advantage it has: naive; single threaded implementation is easy to produce.

Doing something because it is easy is not bad per se, but it needs to be aligned with the larger goals of the project. In our case, it conflicts with the goal of scaling big.
That part of the whitepaper doesn't really say anything about incompatible branches of a fork. However, by that standard, then BTC is the real deal, not BCH.

Now, mining is expensive, by design. It means that miner are actually not free to mine whatever chain they want, at least not for long. They need the chain to be valued by the market. So the longest chain end up being the one the market value the most.

The fact that this DAA discusion was turning into the block size debate 2.0 tells me that abc is still very necessary.

Letting problem in production and continue to do endless debates is not acceptable. There is really no solution other than anticipation.

I trust that solving real problems that users are experiencing in a timely manner is key to bitcoin cash's success. I also believe complaining about being out of the loop on social medias when you put yourself out of the loop - and I was the one who looped you in to begin with - is a giant waste of time. Sue me.

This is what I'm pointing at when I say the community has a weak immune system.  


[Yours.org](https://Yours.org) has been neglected for quite some time now. However, Ryan has the time to make videos on a regular basis promoting his view on various things. It shows that Ryan prioritize being a talking head rather than delivering value to his users. This is not new and predates BSV by a lot.  


To me, it was obvious that Ryan would eventually go off rail after our discussions in Arnhem. He was saying at the time that price follow hashrate because, obviously, there were miner mining before there was a price for bitcoin and, therefore, hashrate must precede price. This thesis was already disproved theoretically by any economics manual, and practically at the time by any GPU mined coin, and was disproved again after Aug, 1, yet Ryan is still maintaining that line of thinking. Not only that, but he decided to follow the minority chain. These are all signs of someone who is not motivated by logic and evidence and cannot adjust one's world view based on facts, and, therefore, is bound to go off rails.
I think it is very clear that bitcoin has problem when the load increases. The sooner we address these problem, especially the ones at the consensus level, the better.
It has been in use in many coins, for instance, Ripple uses Hashtree that are canonically ordered, and Ethereum uses Patricia tree that also are canonically ordered.

These data structures are much more amendable to scaling than the current data structures used in Bitcoin. They also have been in use for a long time, so we know what to expect.

For DSV, its critics have said that it allow to create loops and recursion in scripts and that it would be patented. DSV only checks the validity of an ECDSA signature, so it's not patentable nor can be used to create a loop. This is all FUD.
I can answer that one directly. Because nakamoto consensus is better. Let's say what the whitepaper says:

> They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.

As one one can say miner do not vote for proposals. They do vote by extending the chain that contains proposal they like. There must be a chain that exists to do so to begin with.

"Miner voting" as requested doesn't match what satoshi describes as miner voting, and in fact **prevents** the kind of miner vote described in the whitepaper.
I also said that parallel validation as implemented in BU allow the selfish miner to get gamma very close to 1 by mining empty blocks, which imply we'd need to take countermeasures in ABC before implementing parallel validation.

Right now, ABC process one block at a time, so a selfish miner see gamma being very close to zero all the time.

It is clear that if we want to scale big, we need parallel validation, which also means that you need a countermeasure for selfish mining ensuring gamma remains close to zero in that case.

I don't think trying to fight bitcoin is a good mindset. Bitcoin is small. It's not even as big as Bill Gates. The worlds is much larger. We need to focus on growing the pie, not trying to get a bigger slice of a tiny pie. This is a high cost/low reward mindset.

As for hashrate, it follows price. Grow BCC and you'll grow BCC's hashrate.

Parisian are generally not very friendly people, no matter what language you speak.
SegWit has a ton of problems.

First it is a can kick. Get us to roughly twice current capacity, but there is no plan to go beyond. Solving this problem once and for all is preferable.

In addition, it allows blocks up to 4MB. It means that node needs to be able to absorb block 4 time biggers, but to deliver only twice the capacity. It is a buy two, pay for 4 proposal.

It makes various proofs 3 time biggers. This is a problem for spv, but also for sharding, which is necesary to get to very large scale.

It only solves malleability in some specific cases. Enough to enable LN, but not enough to prevent various malleability attacks such as tho ones done by BitClub recently.

Contrary to claims, it doesn't solve quadratic hashing.

It creates anyonecanspend outputs, so a giant bounty for miner if they reverse its activation. Not sure how likely it is in practice, but this is a bad precedent.

It adds massive amount of technical debt by retrofiting itself in the current protomol as a soft fork.

And finaly, it is pushed by lies and propaganda. Just that one point should make you stop and think.

Even better question, why did Tom Harding voted no after being the one requesting we do CTOR in Nov ? Probably for the same reason he went on and created NayBC.  


The response is, after being away for at least 3 month, Peter R decide to come back and decides to starts a grand debate around CTOR while being up to speed with none of the debate about it whatsoever. Everybody starts to freak out, BSVer use the opportunity to scare everybody a bit more, and suddenly, half of the people have cold feet, and we need to change all the plans.  


Welcome to the circus.
I do think /u/Wecx- sums it up very well. One of the Major reason big blocks are not BTC is that most big blocker either left Blockstream and consort build the roads. Maye they thought that there were being clever and saving money, but it's very clear by now that it instead caused billions - with a B - to be lost instead.

Alternatively, we went through a phase in the bull market where any kind of road got built, most of them leading to nowhere, made by companies who are more interested in being seeing building road than actually ensuring there is a solid transportation network in place.

For better or worse, we are back to square-1, where a lot of the road building is voluntary. The good news is that many actors from phase 2 went away (thought not all), but the risk obviously is that we may not retain all the talent.

In the meantime BTC and BSV are building roads. We may not like where these roads are going, but they are being built. BCH's road are being built, but it's not clear how sustainable it is and how resistant it will be against the next takeover.
I have nothing to prove to you. You are the one making claim, substantiate or accept being called a liar.
I think it is more or less already taking place, in the form of people who did their best to create a situation where csw can do maximum damage now celebrating victory as a way to gain social proof in the community and be ready to do it again.

Watch out, it's going on under your eyes.
Thank you :)
Most startup scaling problems can be solved by buying a big server with one TB of RAM.
Schnorr has been used in the wild for quite some time in the form of eddsa. It's battle tested. It's security depends on the curve used, which in this case would still be secp256k1.
You forgot the part were you couldn't agree with classic on sigops, causing testnet to fork unpredictably. You forgot the part where you were told dev process was innadequate and ended up with 4 zero days in a row. You forgot you did an incident review, after being strongly pushed for it to happen, and did nothing with the results, nor did another incident review subsequently. You forgot that you merged a pr that had comment from myself saying it's innadequate, which ended up with bitcoin.com wasting a block. You forgot the part where I proposed myself to do the work required to improve quality but you refused. You forgot the part where bu hired a contractor to do it, and he ended quitting because the task was hopeless, you simply would not do the changes required. You also forgot the part where you had miners ready to activate granted some activation code was provided, but refused because it needs to be done via ec and everything else is collusion. You forgot the part were bu opposed any change in the difficulty algorithm, forcing us to go with the eda (both ftrader and myself discussed the need to adjust every blocks in the btcforks times). You forgot the part where you asked /u/ftrader to follow an incredibly ineffiscient process to make bch happen within BU, process that he followed, but also ensured bu would never be ready in time.

But most importantly, you forgot why everybody kept quiet about all of this, and started leveraging the info asymmetry to make yourself look good.

You forgot a lot of things, Andrew. I'm worried for you, that may be early signs of Alzheimer.
There is no good defense against this except a price increase. However, because the chain is mined with asics, the available hashrate for an attack is way smaller than with gpu mined coins. In addition of the opportunity cost, the attack also comes at a great cost in term of diversification for miners. Right now, regardless if btc or bch wins, miner win. If they kill one of the two, the kill their diversification, which is a bad move.
BU is well funded. Not sure how much they have, but more than a million. Bitprim is also funded and has several full time devs. I have no idea what XT's situation is.
You can probably soft fork something that break asics. For instance, swap the nonce and version fields.
Thanks. I agree 100&#37; with this.
Sound money. Right now we have precious metals and fiat money, which embody some of the desirable characteristics of money but not others. Cryptocurrencies have the opportunity to combine the desirable characteristics of the 2.
I think it is up to miner to chose what they include or not in a block. Several miners wish to include some amount of free transaction, so we should do it.
To the contrary. SegWit is core's baby. SegWit2x is a validation of their roadmap and a way to keep them in.
It's 2016 !

To be frank, the same strategy worked so many time in different communities thut they didn't see it comming. Shaming do not work on gamers and tirelessly fighting online is what they do.
/!\ I do not think this is /u/freetrader who helped creating Bitcoin Cash.
No, PoW being expensive ensure that miner follows what the market want. This is the beauty fo Bitcoin.
I own almost no BTC, so the ratio BCH/BTC tends toward infinity.
I was happy to be able to say hi. I wish we'll have more time to talk next time.
You don't become a billionaire by not knowing when to cut your losses.
To work well, graphene require cannonical transaction ordering. It also helps with the parallelisation of the block construction and validation.
Yes, this presentation is a great favorite of mine. And if you understand how toxic people works, you'll know they have a huge opportunity to build social capital right now. So keep your eyes open. Not all your friends are your friends.
Well at least you are starting to see the light. There are still a few problems with your model, because, as mentioned in the previous post, the full model involve infinite sums.
Bitcoin ABC has pretty much no business interest but the success of Bitcoin Cash. In fact, it has almost no money of its own, only a handful of BCH donated, mostly but user of this forum (thank you guys, BTW).

People working on counterparty cash are doing great work to bring value to the BCH ecosystem. Why would you not support them ? It's not like it is a consensus change. If consensus is going to be changed, such as OP_GROUP, then the bar is much higher.

If counterparty breaks, only counterparty breaks. If OP_GROUP breaks, bitcoin cash breaks.
I got into Bitcoin in 2010 after reading: https://ploum.net/monnaie-de-geek-monnaie-de-singe/ (this is in French). I was very much interested by the economic aspect of it and saw it a possible world changing. For most of Bitcoin history I did not get involved much because it seemed to be in good hands. This has changed over the past 2 or 3 years.

The ABC team is not well defined, this is an open source project. Myself, /u/ftrader , /u/NilacTheGrim are contributing on a regular basis but many other people do too. This is an open source project, you can be part of the team if you want to by contributing code or other things.

If you do not know C++, then what you can do on ABC itself is limited. However, there is a ton of things that you can do. Bitcoin Cash will only strive if there is a full ecosystem around it, and ABC is just piece of that. There is a ton of software out there such as wallets or didactic websites that could benefit from your skills.
Yes, he can also be stupid.
Well maybe someone is actually using ASICboost.
Rewarding toxicity doesn't looks like it is a smart move.
The last wake up call. Before tomorow.
It is not hard. The floating point representation is as follow :
[sign bit, exponent (8 bits), mantissa (23 bits)]

As this is a square root, I'll assume that the sign bit is 0.

This needs to be interpreted as follow:
n = mantissa * 2^exponent;

And you get sqrt(n) = sqrt(mantissa) * 2 ^ (n/2)

Note that if n is odd, the n/2 won't be an integer, so you can also think of it as sqrt(n) = sqrt(2*mantissa) * 2 ^ ((n - 1)/2)

Both are equivalent, but now you can always pick one to have an integer exponent at the end.

With that in mind, the shift's utility become apparent. Shifting an integer by one on the right is the same as dividing by 2. The first step of the process is computing the exponent of sqrt(n) correctly.

For the mantissa, let's consider the odd and even exponent case separately. In the even case, the mantissa is just divided by 2 as well. But in the odd case, it is divided by 2 and a one is added as most significant bit. So you can see it as the mantissa being divided by 2, and a constant being added to it. This constant is half of the maximum value a mantissa can take.

You can think of the mantissa going in bucket as follow :
even: new_mantissa = mantissa / 2
odd : new_mantissa = mantissa / 2 + mantissa.max / 2

This is good, because if you add one to the exponent, it is equivalent to multiply the mantissa by 2. The extra one you get in the mantissa account for this as a first approximation.

So basically, shifting by one bit on the right will give you a very bad sqrt function, that get the exponent right, but only a gross approximation of the mantissa.

Now let's look at magic_constant - bad_sqrt(n). Doing 1/x is effectively equivalent to changing the bit of the exponent, plus recomputing the mantissa.

aka: 1/(2^n) = 2^-n

So, once again, for the exponent part, it works quite well. You get constant - exponent, which change the sign of the exponent + offset it. The mantissa part of the constant is chosen once again to get a gross approximation: constant - x rather than 1/x. This looks terrible, but it is not that bad, as it has to approximate over [2^exponent .. 2^(exponent+1)], not the full range of possible values.

Note that in this situation, this is the mantissa that can bleed one bit into the exponent because of the carry. If the mantissa become very large, the exponent gets bumped by one as to ends up in the right place by the carry.

Turns out that 0x5f3759df is not the best constant in the general case as it yield worse precision that alternatives over the whole floating point range, but is one of the best for values typically found in graphics.

At this point, you have a gross approximation of 1/sqrt(x) . It turns out, as explained, that this can get the exponent right, meaning you get at most 50% precision, but in fact, you can get much better simply by choosing value that give linear approximation that work reasonably well on the desired range. Approximation on the mantissa only have to work on the [2^n .. 2^N+1] and it turns out that sqrt does not do wild variations and a good approximation can be found.

Now the final step, Newton's approximation. This is technique allow you to create a suite that converge toward the value that you are looking for. It turns out that, because we used black magic level hack to get a reasonable approximation, 1 or 2 iterations only are necessary to get enough precision.

Yes, the one big server doesn't quite work for Bitcoin plus this technique also end up running into the problem that at some point, you can't buy a bigger server.

A startup can change it's infrastructure when reaching that point, Bitcoin cannot so we need to plan ahead now.
> Do you think that, since both coins have picked different parameters in the tradeoffs between privacy and scalability, that atomic swaps between XMR and BCH would be of high value to both communities?

Probably, yes.

> It seems like part of the issue is lack of an appropriate platform for technical people (miners and devs) to interact while retaining transparency for the general public. Reddit, Twitter, Slack - all of these have their issues. Memo.cash is interesting but I think still not conducive to the kinda of in depth conversations that need to occur. Are there any alternatives you think would help improve the governance of BCH?

I do not think medium can help because the problem is not the medium right now. The main problem is that chaotic actors are kept in position of influence, and therefore, chaos ensue.
He made the first spv wallet for bch, before launch. He helped abc and other projects many times as well.

It's fair to say that without him, there is no bch. The same cannot be said of these who smear him.
None of this constitute industry consultation.
I like these proposals. Right now the block size is configurable in ABC, but I would like to have a way to determine this configuration automatically in the future.
Can't talk for bitmain, but this is fairly common. You want to collect data on devices in the wild in order to tune the next version in way that fit actual use in the field.

Bitcoin has recently be a target of these peoples (we are sexists, racists and homophobics because we are mostly white male, you know the song), so that is probably not making things better. But I doubt this is the primary cause.
Guys, you have Calvin Ayre and CSW as advisors on that page: https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin-cash#profile

I don't want to sound rude, but I'm not sure you are qualified to provide any real world information about anything at this stage. I heard a lot of good about you from various people, but clearly, you need to work on your data sources if you want to become a reference.
BU is the best funded BCH project by a very long shot.
The implication of that fact seems to be lost to most. r/bitcoin commited suicide when they started censoring. The censorship wasn't very successful and killed the host.

Then why is BCH a minority chain? While this is true that there was censorship on r/bitcoin, it is unable to explain that result, as we also notice that most of the discussion moved elsewhere. Same goes for bitcointalk.

Someone wise one day said "you can have excuses, or you can have results. You can't have both". It's time for us to drop the excuses and go get results.
I'm a big fan of reciprocity in general. So while I would not advocate for attacking the BSV chain, they also voided any right to complain when they started advocating for killing the minority chain.

If that were to happen, well, karma is a bitch.
By stable, you mean by changing things on a regular basis like adding new opcodes, providing a release days before the fork and with no public testnet ?
Maybe by disavowing these who are trying to do this now.
If I can, I'll go.
Go do a back to the envenoppe calculation of how much capital is required to be locked in chanels given any reasonable set of assumptions. You'll find out you need to lock in all btc in existance way before you reach country scale.
Right now the biggest influence on the bicoin price do not seem to be liquidity, size of the market or anything else. It is, by far Tether. The correlation of the volume of tether and the bitcoin price is almost 1:1 . Check it out.
Thanks to both of you. I don't think these threat have any real merit so I'm not too worried.
Note that these promise have not been made by LN devs themselves. In his initial talk for instance, Poon mention that, according to his estimation, LN would reduce the size of the block required to do worldwide transaction from 1GB to 133MB. Take that number however you want, Poon clearly mentioned that, in his mind, scaling worldwide involve bigger blocks.

I met Poon a few time and he strikes me as a very smart and honest man. This whole LN fairytale is not coming from the LN devs themselves but from useful idiots like Lombrozzo.
While you make some good point, quite ironically, ETH is technically significantly harder to scale than BTC. As a result, it is likely that ETH will suffer from a hangover at some point.

That being said, it won't be to the benefit of BTC unless it gets its shit together real quick.
That was a very clear pump and dump.
He is not blocking anything. There is no right for segwit to activate. The question is "what would convince him to signal it ?"
In his non joke response, he still mention that 1MB is damaging.
Because core is full of intelligent, but not talented people, at least as far as software engineering is concerned.

Most of the merged code wouldn't pass code review in companies like Google or Facebook, or in other open source project that value good engineering, LLVM for instance.

Don't believe me ? Let's have a look: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3dd410294d42f251e4808ef1dfcfcd64817edbac

This implements BIP134, which is good in itself, even if somewhat overengineered. Now consider how amount is passed down to sighash. It's all over the place, breaks all abstractions, adds data duplication. For instance, in TransactionSignatureCreator you get the amount, which is also in the Checker which is a member. It's a sure flag that the data-structure used makes no sense.

Want something else ? Maybe https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/449f9b8debcceb61a92043bc7031528a53627c47 ?

The IsWitnessProgram function is very interesting. Once again, this never passes code review in any somewhat serious software shop. This is the typical example of technical debt. The fact it needs to be checked all over the place should tell any experienced software engineer that the design is fragile, error prone, and shouldn't have been merged without some prior refactoring, and probably some redesign.

Tests contains a good amount of code copied and pasted from the code hey are supposed to test, proving both that the abstraction are fubared and that the test test more the copypastingfu of the dev than the actual feature.

Many test rely on call to sleep to pass. That should scare the hell out of everybody here.

TL:DR: they are smart, but they are at best average software engineer. And there is a good reason for this: the best software engineers can make significantly more working for Google, Facebook, Amazon.
Bernie Sander is very clear on its foreign policy. He doesn't give a shit about foreign poors.
BTC at 500-1000$ do not make any sense. Either the thing pan out, and you'll have a 1000% ROI again, or it collapse, and you'll have ROI at all. There is no BTC in the 3-4 digits in 2 years.

What you are suggesting is equivalent to RBF, except you pay in PoW rather than fee.

There is simply no way to solve that problem with the addition of a consensus rule.

Open source software cannot have such restriction by definition.

It contradicts clause 6, 8 and 9 of the OSD and freedom 0 and 3 of the FSD.
I'm glad you noticed too.
That's a player right there ^


;)
They complained he disclosed before 0.15 is released. However, a 70 days notice is fair game, IMO.
There is work done on the fee management. Finding the right fee structure will take time, if one exist at all. The next version of ABC will reserve a percentage of the block space for low fee transactions. This will improve over time.
If you knew me better you'd know that I screw things up constantly. We need to break free of hero worshiping.
Many think that everybody else wants SegWit so that the coin value will increase. The funny part is, that the coin value will likely increase because many think everybody else wants it.

Truth is, nobody really wants it except a few.  You know that because most people pushing for SegWit have no idea what SegWit even is.

That should also inform us about introducing too much complexity. Is segwit as a softfork such a great idea after all ?

In anyway, we should keep in mind that these kind of event happened to bitcoin in the past, for instance when someone created millions of coins dues to an integer overflow.

Last but not least, funny how talking about altcoin is banned, yet this thread is currently #1 .
Context switch on modern cpu are about 1000 cycles, plus trashing of various caches like tlb.

Microkernel simply cannot be performant on the kind of cpu we have right now. And if the os is slow, everything is slow.

Microkernel looks great on paper, but unless cpu evolve significantly, they just won't be fast enough.

Hi Georges,

I'm happy you are making progress on your work. However, the way the results on this type of work is focusing on metric that IMO do not really matter.

First, the compression from base size is not very useful. It is better to compare to currently deployed tech to know what kind of improvement we are looking at. Compact Block would be a good baseline in our case.

Second, and probably most importantly, what actually matter is latency.
Stop giving him attention.
Thank you. Now, be sure that this is only the first step in the journey. There is more to do before that thing is as secure as it could be given the auditability of the chain.
I'm not saying it is a bad thing. I stated before that infra done well is mostly invisible to users.

But this is the kind of change that fall int he bucket of making growth possible, rather than creating growth to begin with. Avalanche and CashShuffle do provide value directly to users, in a visible manner.
I do not know. Surely providing a source would prove that Craig is not making shit up out of thin air.

I suspect this comes from ABC with patches such as Bitcore, wish are known to buckle under load, but are very commonly used as backend for wallets. There are numerous patched versions of ABC out there.
I think that it is wrong to think that miner lead the network. Mining is very expensive, so miners cannot keep a chain running at a loss for very long. This is why we see today many miners favoring big blocks mining BTC anyways. At the end, the market always decides.
Now this looks like more of a professional test plan. Thanks /u/jtoomin .

War is expensive, and it's not where the big prize is. You get it.
A technology like FT require to get the wallet onboard. Now is the time to let wallet catch up and add good support. We need to make sure we have a healthy ecosystem and constantly breaking wallets doesn't help this.

We will in time introduce a new transaction format, but this needs to be planned well in advance and everybody must be given time to make it happen.
Yes, i think this is an important issue. Sadly because of the number of actors involved, this isn't that easy to update the address format. bech32 is a format used for segwit addresses. It is a very good format, and I think BCC should adopt something similar - but different enough so that both address format are incompatible.
His paycheck depends on it. Or if not that's really sad.
Blockstream is funded by banks, yes. Whether they have patent on SegWit or not is unknown at this time. Some people suspect they do but there is no proofs so take it with a grain of salt.
Hashpower are miners putting real world resources (supply) to produce something useful, a secure ledger (demand). It's the most straightforward example of a market.
There is no overwhelming acceptance of SegWit on main net.
Smart enough coder do not want to join a group that have no idea how to scale a system past 1MB per 10mins. If you had any such coder in your circles, they could tell you how ridicule that sound.

You may want to think about what "decentralized and permissionless" means.

BIP is a centralized process, managed by luke-jr .
Headshot.
I'd like to use this thread to remind us something.

We got into Bitcoin because we shared a vision. We wanted to go to the Moon. We wanted the world to use it. We wanted the world to be a better place for using it.

I think many of us lost our rage to succeed. We need to get it back. Moral is important. Moral is paramount.

If you feel down, please take a week off the btc world. Come back energized and ready to fight. We'll be waiting for you. We have a dragon to slay.
Dude, you project so much you should consider opening a theater. You'd make a fortune.

The censorship elsewhere is the very reason why Roger ended up in control of alternative discussion places like this one to boot.
You don't need to spend that much, considering bitcoin is running at capacity all the time.
The halving is coming. That means miner won't make as many BTC per block as they do now. As a result, it is likely that some miner will stop mining as it is not profitable for them to do so anymore.

It means that average block time after the halving is likely to increase until difficulty is re-calibrated, which happen about every 2 weeks in normal time.

If half of the miner leave the network, that means that block will only be mined every 20 mins instead of the usual 10, and also it means that re-calibration will need twice as long to happen. That mean that for a while, network capacity and latency will suffer, which is especially a problem because blocks are full.

Adam is proposing to soft fork the difficulty. Ie he is proposing that miners fake their blocks in order to calibrate the difficulty to be half of what it actually is in such a way that current nodes will accept it.

Considering block difficulty is the basis of BTC's security, miners fucking with it is the last thing you want. Adam proposing this seriously is scary to say the least.
Hopefully, Adam will explain to amazon that they are using bitcoin wrong and all will be solved. Amazon will stop using bitcoin and that will be proof that the lighting network is awesome. Trust the experts.
He sees the world as a zero sum game. So the rich making money is literally stealing from the poorer in this worldview.
Ok, /r/btc is so far in tinfoil hat land that I end up upvoting one of your posts...

Good news, there is already a regulated uber. It is called taxi and exist in most cities around the world.

Because, as Bernie states, regulation makes things great, there is no doubt that this pesky uber thing will disapear in priofit of the glorious taxi alternative.
Well that is not that bad. It reduce the time loss.
> for some reason out of my control that hasn't happened.

You banned me from all your channels after me and /u/jonald_fyookball reported a security vulnerability to you, and have been playing the clueless victim since then. That may have something to do with it.
They also accepted it from day 1. Vit is a great guy.
He also said that he'd follow the longest chain, while following the minority split of a minority split.
I think not only there is probability, but in fact there are good evidence that this is exactly what they were trying to do.

You'll notice that BMG did not mine any block on the BSVision chain untill it was discovered that ABC added a post fork checkpoint (which we do with every single fork, so that tells you how much they know about what's going on). At which point they started to complain about the checkpoint and BMG starts mining on BSVision.

Where was BMG's hashrate ? Well let me tell you: building a deep reorg.
Up to the last checkpoint, which is at the fork in may last year.
ex post facto justification.
The world will never decide to settle on a battleground if it has any alternative.
It's not force, it's just the market doing its thing.
A lot of unnecessary confusion will happen. Hopefully people will figure out which's actors are reliable and which flip flop and create uncertainty. This will makes things better going forward.
> What's your strategy with the upcoming hardfork ?

It hasn't changed for the past several month. I think it's very important to provide predictability to the ecosystem. We have a testnet, we have a client, it's all ready to go.

> Do you believe Bitcoin BCH is really under threat of toxic people (I won't cite names, but we all know who's I'm talking about)

It absolutely is. Not because of the toxic people, there are toxic people everywhere. Because the ability to recognize them and ostracize them is still very weak with the Bitcoin Cash community.
And yet we are on that chain. What does that say about us ? That we do not follow miner vote.
How do you keep fee sub 1ct in these conditions ?
They can. It's like you have a door that doesn't lock, and you fix it adding a second door with a good lock on it. Zero security improvement.
You are a free man on a free market. If you want to tell me what to do, I'm happy to send you the bill. How much do you pay ?
Shaders is behind the other opcodes, not ABC. Shaders went through the process of gathering feedback on the proposal and changed it several time as per feedback. He received feedback from ABC member, but also people like Gavin. The proposal is just in solid shape at this point.

OP_GROUP was made with zero feedback and contradictory claims made about it's planned inclusion such as it has absolutely zero review at this point. When concern are raised, proponent decide to start drama on social media rather than address the concerns. This is a recipe for maximum drama and minimum results.
Indeed, this is already very late as far as I'm concerned and I would have preferred putting code out there and starting outreach much sooner. If that were in my hands only, I wound have proceeded much sooner.
Honestly, I think Segwit2x main selling point was to avoid a split, but now that it happened, I'm not sure this makes a lot of sense now. Segwit1x and Segwit2x cannot coexist unless they implement something like EDA so the future is very uncertain, and uncertainty favor status quo.
Spammer will discover that it is indeed bloody expensive to spam bcc.
Almost nobody uses sw on litecoin.
Relative to other coins, the price doesn't grow much. So yes, this is what's happening.
To the contrary, he ran several to the ground.
It's absolutely not excellent.

 - OP claims there are no technical argument against SegWit. This is false.

 - OP claims that SegWit solves the quadratic hashing problem. This is false.

 - OP claims SegWit changes the incentive to grow the UTXO set. This is false ( https://youtu.be/_Z0ID-0DOnc?t=2h25m33s )

 - OP claims LN is a general purpose scaling solution. This is false (the capital needed grows out of control, run the numbers).

 - OP claims ASICboost is a reason for miner to clock SegWit. This is false (SegWit doesn't prevent ASICboost and there are no proof that ASICboost is used at all to begin with).

Kids, this is what censorship does to your brain.   
When you can't argue with crazy, you outcrazy them :) 
> Sure there is, there is the original block limit. One of the reasons we were able to convince people worried about a blocksize increase that segwit's capacity increase was safe was because it did not increase the UTXO bloat exposure.

This limits the growth rate, not the growth itself.

> There aren't multiple classes of UTXO, they are all equal, differing only in their scriptPubkey, just like 2 of 3 multsig is different from 5 of 7.

You can't spend non segwit UTXO using segwit and vice versa. There are definitively 2 classes of UTXO. Also, all the problems "solved" by segwit are inf act only solved for segwit UTXO.
> It cannot be permitted to work. The community response to **devs** saying "Under mine the rules of Bitcoin to benefit us, or we'll screw with the network" must always be a resolute "You are fired!".

I fixed that for you.
Maybe alienating half the community without demonstrating any expertise wasn't the best PR strategy...
It is only a surprise if you created an echo chamber for yourself.
There are studies. Depending on the area, it is typicaly 5% to 12% .
There is a fair amount of data out there that show women consider about 80% of men to be bellow average (which mathematically very unlikely, but attraction do not care about math).
You never really really run into the limit. See https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4iivtf/committed_bloom_filters_for_improved_wallet/d2ylwlk for details. There is also a good interview by vimeo's CEO that explains it.

You NEVER run into the limit. You just stop growing and eventually become irrelevant.

> Whether to call this an 'airdrop' or not is not an interesting question IMO. 

If you want to go that road though, BTC is an airdrop of an airdrop of an airdrop. And the original bitcoin made in satoshi has been dead for several years.
Very good question. Having LN on top of BCH would indeed be extremely valuable and would work better than on top of BTC.
Don't ask when. Make it happen.
> What do you think the one full node reference client exists for in BTC - to lock down the protocal & to create stability for development!

I've been trying to explain this to other BCH participant since day 1. Locking down is a bad idea, but it is very important to roll out changes slowly, in a way that is well planned many month in advance and not do changes frivolously.

This is not a shared value among the BCH key opinion leaders, so it has made this extremely difficult to pull off. Many favor scoring quick short term political point on scoial media.

BSV definitely benefited from this. They are pushing that narrative and it is working for a reason. I do not think they do hold up to these values - for instance, CTOR was planned for more than a year and they decided to make it as disruptive as possible at the last, which clearly goes against their stated objective of stability - but it doesn't really matter because we do not either. They are signaling to the market what it wants to hear, and the market is responding.

BCH needs to take note or the market will do its job.
Prove me wrong, provide a source for your claim that abc supports shorter block time.
His persuasion techniques are very strong nevertheless. Consider this, he convinced a bunch of people, using social media, to repeat ad nauseam, on social media, that saying things on social media is useless. He also convinced a big chunk of the ecosystem that he was a brilliant scientist with poor social skills, when in fact he is completely incompetent as a scientist, but has extremely good social skills.

Part of the community was fooled, the other part did underestimate him. This is why we are in the situation we are.
Mining at a 100% loss with several EH/s is a pretty expensive stunt.
Making bitcoin is not a crime. However, not paying taxes is.
Yes, there are several ways you can define 1% here, so it's unclear what the actual answer is. Yours also make sense, though you must assume that many of these wallets belong to the same person, there is really no good way to know.
The larger a miner, the less impacted it is by the orphan rate. So a very large miner would benefit. Nobody else would.
Everything /u/evoorhees says seems to be applicable to BCH much more than BTC.

It's easy. Net neutrality is what makes economic sense for an isp in a free market. What cost them is getting you connected, it doesn't really matter if you transmit data or not as far as their costs structure is.

But the us got the brilliant idea to make its isp monopoles. As a result, they can abuse their position. While you pay for your connexion, they also want to extort google, facebook, netflix and other companies you are connecting to (companies which also already pay an isp on their side).

Where it gets weird is that, instead of repealing the rules which cause isps to misbehave in the first place, people are asking for more rules in order to get the isp behave in a mre favorable way, which usually end up backfiring in a bad way.
To the contrary, BU has been running a big block testnet for quite some time now and BCC shows that bigger block also are possible. I think the case that bigger blocks are indeed safe has been made again and again.

As for code quality, this is a very good concern. First, we have several implementation, which is good because it is unlikely that they all have the same bug. This is important because no matter how good we are and how hard we try, it is a given that we'll have bugs in there at some point.

As for ABC specifically, we take this seriously. For instance, recently, /u/NilacTheGrim added support for ASAN, TSAN and UBSAN builds for ABC.
I think it is none of your concerns.
I had a grant to do research on scaling solutions. We'll see how it goes from there.
> I'll be on a shorter, slower chain

That'll depend on hashrate support, and only temporary.

> but I won't have segwit.

Indeed it won't. It'll fork off Aug, 1 . There is "block must be big" rule that will definitively fork the chain.
No I've noted it as well. A lot of proposed solution are provably not realistic with simple back of the envelope calculation.

But these calculation have a funny way of telling you "You were completely wrong, you are an idiot" so I guess many don't like to do them.
Don't use a segwit wallet and you are good.
Now let me tell you what's going to happen.

SW will activate. Then you'll see a fear-mongering campaign to scare miners from doing a HF. Because HF is a chicken game, meaning that if most people do it at the same time, then it's alright, but if some miner jump alone, then it's a really costly mistake, this fear-mongering campaign will actually be effective.
Including remote shutdown. Not saying I think it is the ideal, but it is standard industry practice. Google can remote shutdown your android phone. Same goes for 99% of connected devices.
No, cracking an address is not finding a collision, it is finding a pre image. This is why 160bits of security is enough for p2kh.

On the other hand, in case of a multiparty script, attacking the address for one of the party is a collision attack, in which case, 160bits of security isn't enough.

Imagine alice and bob create a multisig address. Bob can get Alice's key and grind until he finds a key that give the same hash that some other output he know how to spend. For this he needs to find a collision, which is 2^80 ops. On the other hand, Carol would need 2^160 ops to crack the address.

2^160 is secure. 2^80 is secure as well, but it is playing with the limit. If the hash function is weakened in any way, it quickly falls. To put it with djb's tems, 160 is boring crypto, 80 is exciting crypto :)

In any case, there is no multiparty p2kh addresses, so using a 160bits hash for these is alright. Shnorr enables n out of n multisig with p2kh, so that may need to be reevaluated then. 
Note that rement version of bu and classic will follow the main branch, and, if sw wins, they'll follow the sw branch because it is a soft fork.

On the other hand, your node will fork itself out of the network if big block are comming. If your thing is safety and wait and see, running bu or classic seems like a safer bet.
> or risk a contentious hardfork. 

There is no such thing. If you don't want to follow the hardfork chain, you don't have to. Only soft fork can be contentious, and segwit sure is.
If you get dating advice from scrubs, then you get what you deserve.
SegWit hard fork could be compatible with existing UTXO. If you remove the economic meddling such as the discount for witness data, this is actually cool tech.

The witness structure itself is an improvement, BIP143 is a HUGE improvement, script versioning is also an nice improvement. There is a lot to be taken from SegWit.

But the fact they want to do it as a softfork puts a lot of constraint and forces the solution to be convoluted and do not deliver it's full potential, as it only work on SegWit UTXO - meaning, for instance, that quadratic hashing and malleability are NOT solved by SegWit, unless you ant to destroy pre SegWit UTXO, which would also be a soft fork. That means fungibility issues. Plus the anyone can spend problem, and a few others things.

The compromises made to make SegWit a soft fork are such as it needs to be rejected.
In one case, you can use bitcoin but not run a node, in the other you can run a node but not use bitcoin.

If you think that makes any sense, I have some bad news for you: you aren't the brightest guy around here.

2 is so sadly true. Every single time we have one of these big security hole, modern languages would have rejected the code at compile time.

I understand that one may want to reduce safety for performance, for instance, but that tradeof makes abolutely no sense if the software's goal is to ensure safety.
Are you sure ?

People were pretty retarded yesterday. Pretty much as much as they are today. Maybe even more.
Tesla don't wanted to date as it is a distraction. Newton most likely died a virgin (there are no trace of him being involved in any realtionship). Einstein tried to make a contract with his wife to deal with her bullshit. Darwin did is work basically ignoring his wife, who was very religious and probably one of the first creationst nutjob. Mendeleiev risked prison to get rid of his wife.

Yes, there is a pattern !

But Milo still has a point. The instinct that pushes these men to achieve is the reproductive one. This is why you see mostly men adopting these behavior.

DYOR. This is a trap.
Theology. Not kidding, for real.
Ryan is losing the plot. His opposition to CDS is that it is & million time more efficient, which seems like a benefit rather than a inconvenient. It's akin to saying we must not have car because we can go places walking, even if for ages.

His argument that it is a subsidy do not hold water. It assumes that:
1/ Miners cannot charge a different price for CDS, which is blatantly false.
2/ Miners do not benefit, but CDS is also cheaper for miners than his proposal, so it is a win-win operation, not a subsidy.
3/ That you can know the computational cost of a script by its size, which is not even close to be remotely true.
4/ CDS already has monetary use cases: https://gist.github.com/awemany/619a5722d129dec25abf5de211d971bd

Finally, and ironically, nChain's OP_DIV/OP_MOD and OP_MUL can also be implemented using more basic opcodes.
Steeve is claiming that ABC banned nChain from the instant transaction event when ABC was not part of the organization and had, as a result, no power to do such a thing. The reality of the situation is that nChain attacked almost all sponsors at some point (notably bitmain, bitcoin.com, bitcoin unlimited, permissionless ventures), taped on Satoshi's Vision's brand by naming their client in a similar manner - which the conf creators were not exactly happy with, and attacked most of the participants at some point in time as well, resulting in a situation were nobody really wanted to have them present.
> It appeared to me that our current changes were only announced one week before the feature freeze.

Absolutely. This is a huge issue. This is due to the fact that everybody comes up with its set of change they want at the last minute and ABC tried to accommodate as much as possible. This turned out to be a mistake, because these who did not get their change in are now throwing a tantrum and these who did get them are now pretending these were ABC change all along.

You can bet this'll be different next time.
No, they will say that what they did was very necessary and they did it for the good of bch. They are the true heroes, and you were too clueless to see through the genius.

Mark my words. It's going to happen.
Yes. It would have been even smarter to describe it as something like "ensure we check for duplicated inputs in checkblock." This way you do not tell the whole world that there isa crash bug. People will eventualy figure it out, sure, but there is no good reason to help them.

After the release is done, the problem can be disclosed and test cases submited to the project publicly.
Core and cash both have a legitimate claim to the bitcoin name. If BCH accumulate more work than BTC, I'll say it's unambiguously bitcoin.

Sorry, I'm not for sales.
Miner are currently voting 10:1 for BTC, so I think it's pretty clear that voting doesn't give us what we want.

The way i see thing, dev talk to businesses to know the user problem talk to miner to know their problem, try to come up with a roadmap that addresses both and talk to other dev to align roadmaps. All of this was done to the extent possible for the November upgrade (we did not have contact with several pools such as raw pool until recently).

There is nothing preventing anyone from publishing any counter proposal at any time to disrupt everything. At the end of the day, the capability of such actor to create chaos is limited by how much the community enable that actor. If the community decides to rewards such behavior, it'll get more of it, not less.
I would be for implementing schnorr, but not confidential transaction, at least not in the main chain. As an extension block, however, that's an interesting idea.
Plus first seen is inherently subjective, so it can NEVER be a consensus rule.
It's open source anyone can submit a patch. And in the grand scheme of things, being able to symlink the wallet is not the #1 priority, so you'll either have to wait, or have to make it happen if it is very important to you and/or urgent.
This is how science is done.

1/ Make an hypothesis, state expectations.

2/ Conduct an experiment.

3/ If the experiment do not match expectation, adjust world view accordingly.


Did you write a client for the next HF before ABC ? No ? Well so you got your answer.
ETH transaction count is not a very interesting metric as it really measure something else.
You may be surprised, but I share most of your concerns. Except for bitcoin cash vs bitcoin core. That is imo the best way to distinguish two coins which both have a legitimate claim to the bitcoin name.
For once, you get better data for the difficulty adjustement. I do agree that something like bobtail seems more promising, but this is in their roadmap. It's clear that we can't change this kind of parameters without thoughtful considerations, but what are we going to think about if nobody experiment with it to begin with ?

Yes, they are the required groundwork. 
This opens various DoS vector, so probably not a good idea. But we need to make sure the block size stay ahead of the demand going forward.
Well, bad code is bad code. Being straightforward about it is important. We are here to deliver high quality software to users. Not saying what's wrong doesn't help. And like everybody I fuck up constantly.

Yes, I do not consider readability changes as unimportant, and generally apply the boy scout rule: leave the code in better shape than you found it.
I don't think he is, and I don't think it matters if he is.
You don't need to be a pro. Most of the codebase is garbage to begin with. 
These aren't gotcha question. The answer to these question do not show that segwit is not suffiscient for scaling, it show that the whole roadmap makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

See this is the whole problem here: facts don't matter anymore. They are considered gotcha questions. These aren't, these are the question one much ask himself here. Back to the envolope calculation and sizing is Eng 101 and nobody wants to do it because reality disagree with the agenda.
If BU was rejected, then segwit was super rejected.
Activating sw would not diversify client implementations. In fact it would do the reverse. SegWit is not supported by most clients.
> Then we'll likely stay stagnated while both sides are stubborn.

That is factually inaccurate. One side compromised again and again. That doesn't fit the definition of stubborn. Then, this side noticed that compromising was not yielding any result and stopped doing it. Changing its position when faced with facts is not stubbornness, it is in fact it's the exact opposite.
Classic created flextrans, which solve the same problem as a hard fork. It is much less complex.
Long story short: it is supported by big money and has control of most plateforms. For most outsiders, it is looking like they have large support.

BSVision is the fantom coin. No block explorer, no code for more than a month now, no payment processor, no nothing, really. Just a lot of hashrate.

This is true. This request was relayed to me and I even agreed to it, even though I wasn't really happy with it, but at the end, I'm not sure what happened on the background, but this was not done.

CSW launched me numerous death stares during his presentation, he was visibly affected by the fact I was in the room.

This relation is maintained by the fact that each transaction contains a hash of its parents. TTOR do not provide such information, it uses it.

I think individual should have a right to privacy. I'd be happy if wallet included a mixing feature turned on my default such as Bob wallet: https://bobwallet.github.io/ or cashshuffle: https://cashshuffle.com/

But there are other properties that are important. Auditability of the chain is important for instance, so that if a bug exist and is exploited (such as the 184Billion bitcoin bug: https://bitfalls.com/2018/01/14/curious-case-184-billion-bitcoin/ ) it can be detected and fixed. Scaling is important as well.

It would be nice to be able to audit public institution, but I'm not quite sure they'll be willing to do it, and if everybody can be audited, then there is a very real risk of Orwellian nightmare becoming true.
> Amaury have you not been a developer for BU or still are a member of the dev team? Why not continue working together with BU instead of trying your own implementation called Bitcoin ABC?

I did some dev for BU and I'm a BU member. However, while working on BU, it became very clear to me that more than code, BU needed better processes. However i was never allowed to really improves things on that front so I moved on to do other things.

> So if you have left BU what has been the reason of this split up?

See question 1. Dev process was inadequate and I was not in a position to improve it. This lead to a situation where several BU memeber asked me in private to present myself against Andrew Stone as lead dev of BU during the next election, but I did not think it was wise as it would have created too much drama.

> How comes Bitcoin SV, slack and stuff? Your view on the story?

The software has not been released, the pool doesn't work, the seeder doesn't work either. There is no testnet.

Bitcoin SV is a lot of noise and not a lot of work so far.

You are correct that I met CSW in France. We discussed CTOR, and it became clear during that meeting that 1/ CSW has no idea what CTOR was nor he had any good reason to oppose it. He ended blaming Tomas van der Wansem for having explained it badly (which I think was a lie) and ended up agreeing. Like in November where he agreed and then changed his mind, he did it again after Paris. I don't think he is willing to cooperate in good faith.

> Can you explain in ELI5 the differences between Anarcho-Capitalist Libertarianism and Benevolent dictatorships that makes me curious.

On 20 posts, 10.5 are about /r/bitcoin or link there. This sub actually talk more about /r/bitcoin than about bitcoin itself. But worst, among the rest of the things, you have tweets (thank you, I have a tweeter account), several are user report that may very well be fabricated to push the narrative - or at least are clearly cherry picked, and actual news about what is going on in the bitcoin ecosystem do not have more than a few upvotes.

You know what, I ask nothing more than talking about bitcoin in an uncensored environment. The question that remains is "When do we start ?"
Everything will be alright if you stop being such a fucking pussy.
Stopped at microservice. If you can't build a monolithic codebase without creating a huge mess, microservice will just provide you an alternative way to hang yourself.
Dude, you really need to educate yourself about relativity. You are doing the same as Dawkin in the video: saying stupid stuff about something you clearly know nothing about.
Well women are far supperior to men, if one does not care about transportation, electricity, water, internet, housing, and so much more. We'd be starving in grass hute, but we sure could run the hr departement !
But feminists care about men too ! We know this because they keep repeating it.
Considering the shitty position you are in, you can't, she clearly didn't do the best for you. It seems that screwing your father over was more important than you for instance.

Granted, blaming your mother is not the most constructive thing to do right now. But painting her as a saint goes against all facts presented so far.
Carefully choosen numbers lead to this result. The author would not see the same increase for memory size above his measurement. If he did the experiment, he'd notice that once you defeat the cache, the line flattens.

As O(N) measure the worse case scenario, be it in instructions or in time as in the article, it is correct to say that the access is O(1) (but you can get better performances for small memory chunks).
So I guess this this the appropriate time to raise my hand, mention I'm the author and start an AMA session :)
Don't worry, they'll be demanding their fair share in 5 years.
They have been expelled of mainstream movment. They are feminists by the book definition, but are shunned by all organizations. That is quite telling.
> BCH, which was/is bitcoin is about hashrate keeping the chain safe

You must be mistaken. It's about peer to peer digital cash.
He fucked up too. But also never really was a KOL within BCH.
Martti is cobra.
This has nothing to do with going after any belief. The non aggression principle definitively warrant defending oneself. It state that INITIATING force is bad, not that using force is bad in all and every case.

The game theory is very clear: the most intolerant minority wins. See https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15 . Having a poor grasp of these dynamic is right now one of the biggest weakness of BCH and its ecosystem.
I think mimblewimble is great as it is the first privacy tech that actually scale. It has serious usability challenges though, so who knows what will happen.
They DDoSed themselves with a 64MB block. The block is now about 20 mins old, and all SV nodes still don't have it.
I see no ABC dev making any claim here. Do you have a source ?
You can't, because it's all little endian in scripts.
You don't become a billionaire by being a complete idiot.
There are 21 millions, so 210 000 to have 1% . If you mean in the 1% of the population that's the richest, if you live in the us or europe, there is a good chance you already are in that group.
It was vulnerable in the same core was as the same code was used. The latest version is not vulnerable.
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14247
By using script opcodes that are valid only on one chain. This is hard to do. Coinex can do it for you if you trust them.
I cannot answer your question because you have a case of "wet road causes rain" assumption backed in it.

The people using and holding Bitcoin Cash have the true power because they give the coin its value. And they also do get the longest chain fairly quickly as a result f the coin having value.

So guess it's a case of option 3. But really, it's not **my** opinion, it's just how economics works.
Market and therefore users and investors decides the fate of the chain. Not miners and not devs.
Right now, the software needs to support both topological ordering and lexicographic ordering, so it's not really possible to optimize. After November, it'll be possible to improve the software to take advantage of lexicographic ordering.
I'm not sure I understand the question. We are not a Bitcoin Cash fork but the software that power most of it's infrastructure.
If no agreement can be found, then it is indeed the best solution. It gives miners as well as other investors more options.
This statement is a pack of lies. I don't need to argue, the audio will be available soon and jonald already described these events so people can check here: https://www.yours.org/content/my-experience-at-the-bangkok-miner-s-meeting-9dbe7c7c4b2d
The word you are looking for is darvo.

Daniel is correct. Investor pay the miners via inflation.

You work ? You have a boss ? Does your boss pays you or do you pays your boss ? Who's paying who ?
Then maybe Erik want to stop talking about cheap transaction and bitcoin being valuable because of its transaction network. Clearly none of this is applicable to BTC.
No that happens by itself. Just like bug fixes and everything else. It's magic.
It can be you if you want to: 1HGDQEwpbEG4FZCETbdnjcEfHmhbKkvhBV

If you don't want to, then the answer is not you.
Keep in mind that going from an experiment to production quality software will take some time. But yes, gigablocks are definitively possible.
Nothing, as long as we keep the copyright notice stating that part of the code comes from monero. That's the whole point of open source.
To be fair, Greg did not do it. But he sure accused others.
Honestly, this is a vulnerability within SegWit, and that was pointed out time and time again. Fixing SegWit's problem is not exactly the #1 item on BCC's roadmap. We told you it was a bad idea.
So this is the famous "we want people with 10 years of blockchain experience" all over again ?

We have numerous people who know how to code on our side as well. The bitprim folks created their own node implementation for instance, this is no small feat.

Honestly, believe Core's propaganda at your own risk. Fighting against it is not something that is a big interest to me.
1. Faster block time come with a lot of scaling issues of their own. I suggest you get familiar with these. The topic has been explored by many altcoins.

2. The potential for massive hash swing is not caused by EDA, it is caused by one coin being more profitable to mine than the other at any point in time. As a result, your proposed solution doesn't help. It is also not a soft fork.

3. This is probably the least important thing that can be worked on, honestly.
Your perception is good :)
Both pieces of code are using a different algorithm. The one from core is subject to related key attack.
To paraphrase /u/solex : People consider the right price for a transaction is 5ct. One way or another, the price of one transaction will be 5ct , either because we scale or because people leave.
Logic has no place in this debate !
> or a start what you are proposing would split the blockchain in 2, with 2 different coins as a result

Fake news. Reading what comes after that is wasted time. Garbage in, garbage out.
It's more complicated, however. Who pay the tariff depend on the relative elasticity of supply and demand. The less elastic you are, the more you'll pay.

You also create deadweight loss, as some people will stop trading, plus rentseeking behavior from suppliers on the right side of the wall. You got to pay for this in addition of the tariff itself, so it's more epensive than just the tariff's price.
Doom3 is very different. More of an horror game than push forward combat. Still a lot of action, but very different.
Truth right there. If blocks are 900k and the limit at 1M you need 100k of tx to clog the system. if blocks are 2M, then you need 1.1M . The fee would have to be 11 time less expensive for the same attack to become cost effective.
SegWit doesn't fix maleability and quadratic hashing. It can only introduce a new tx format where this problem doesn't exist. Existing format is still there and can't be phased out as segwit has incompatible utxo.

You got to love that one. Bitcoin users are now the majority of Bitcoin users. This very profound revelation was provided to you by Meltem Demiror.

But you'd be wrong to think she is dumb. She is being manipulative.
Satoshi explains in the whitepaper that he expect most users to use SPV, but more secure than today's SPV as they can check proof generated by nodes.

That means nodes are not expected to be run by average joe, but by tech savy joe, on a good machine or in a datacenter.

Today, not all nodes can process this amount of data, but clearly a good server can process WAY more than 1Mb every 10 min. Think about it, you can find a server with several hundread gigs or RAM today for not that much. You can fit the whole blockchain + the UTXO set in memory.
Obviously they are, the other sub is censored.
Because nobody wants to contribute in a toxic environement.
You know what creates UTXO bloat ?

Unspendable output because fee > output value.
Can you provide some details ?
When the guy "forking" has 20times more contributions than the second most prolific contributor, this is not a fork. This is GNU getting fired.
Yes, the candidate definitively deserve a clear yes or no.
True. But I'm sure they do handle more than 3 tps.
Yep Adam has experience with talking to random joe. He is really good at it.
These guys are out of touch with reality. It is abundantly clear that bitcoin is not valued at $400 for a network that is more expensive to use than credit cards and can't process more than 3tps.

The expectation of capacity increasing is included in the price. When thing hit the ceiling hard, these guys will have a major crisis to solve, while they could have avoided it all.

Hearn is not quitting because XT did not catched up. He made the reason he quit abundantly clear, and these guy reaction do nothing other than confirm Hearn's arguments.

I'm still in agreement with Gavin: Hearn is a bit too quick to quit, but I've been in his shoes and understands him. The position he was in is simply too draining.
Won't linear increase be a problem in case of explosive growth ?
A good friend doesn't do what you want or what pleases you, but what you need.
To be fair, and as a compiler writer, I wouldn't advertise compiles to C as a feature. C is a really bad intermediate language for compiler to work with.

But back to the other points, realtime GC, what does it even means ? static types ? Everything from Java to Haskell has static types, including all other languages mentioned here.

I have no idea if Nim is good or bad, I literally have 0 experience with it, but this kind of PR sounds very Buzzword Bingo! and not so much solid engineering.
More women should do construction work. This a women friendly work environement that does not use oppressive patriarchal air conditionning. Paradise.
This happened in Cyprus not long ago. Same cause, same consequences. It just takes longuer in richer and bigger countries.

Portugal, you are next.
Obviously, like toilet paper, orange juice is not a necessity to live. It is a luxury product. But don't worry everything you really need is very cheap.
Poe's law in action.
If you think the point was about bit level feature comparison, you missed the point entirely.

The point was about overall consistency in the language. IE the exact opposite of what you say it is.
You forgot one small detail. Men are required to provide for parents when they get old in China. Women aren't. People don't have a preference for male because they like them, but because they have economic insentive to do so.
Hostile behavior like the one you are demonstrating here is exactly what works best to be delisted, as demonstrated today.
In its current form, implementation and activation by default in something like the bitcoin.com wallet is very premature.

The constant hysteria produced by this kind of posts is very detrimental to the engineering work toat needs to happen for something as sensitive as coinshuffle. Thereality is that numerous small things can leak your privacy and so moving forward require small, slow, very deliberate steps.

In addition, this bkind of statement from roger sets the wrong expectations. This is extremely detrimental to BCH. The message sent is that you can produce anything of any quality and in fact maybe not even get to completion (see XThinner) or ignoring all provided feedback (see graphene) and you'll be on the news. This ends up creating an endless stream of low quality or unfinished projects and attracts narcissists, which lead people actually doing the infrastructure work in a state of having to constantly deal with fire.

If BCH is to succeed, this needs to be addressed.

Now is the time for cashshuffle to get actual data about usage. Estimate what kind of privacy it actualy provides from real usage patterns. Go through a few iterrations to maximise privacy. Estimate scallability and do sizing for the systems that will need to run for 100x more users. This probably means more servers. That also means extra opportunity to leak privacy, by having a pattern in the way you pick servers.

Having a bunch of people "super excited" in the room is not helping. This is very difficult work.
Can you guys submit a spec so that it can be made intorroperable? So far, I don't think there has been a lot of review of the protocol.
Coming from you, I have to take it as a compliment.

Thank you.
Roger did turn around eventually. Is it all good? Maybe.

The support of CSW from Roger and many other BCH KOL costed a lot to **ALL** BCH holder and supporters. See it that way: we all chipped in to buy Roger an education. Quite literally, if you own any BCH.

If Roger graduates, then that's okay. I would have preferred Roger to be able to get educated from the cheap option (listening to the numerous people who got to him) but he picked the expensive option (mine at a loss, assets depreciations, ...). If he doesn't graduate, then no, it's not good at all.

Not even close. There are about 4 EH/s on the BSV chain. That is about 286 000 S9. A S9 require 1320W of electricity to function, so we are talking about 380MW of electricity.

Cheap electricity is usually somewhere in the 4ct to 5ct per kWh, so we are talking $15k to $19k per hour. This does not include the depreciation of the miner themselves, the facility, security, maintenance and so on. In fact the electricity itself is underestimated because getting the power from several kV to what a S9 uses is not 100% efficient. Actual costs are probably more in the $20k to $25k range.

At about $45 per BSV, that is $3375 in revenue.

According to these estimates, nChain and coingeek are burning somewhere around $400k to $500k a day keeping BSV alive.
This is not strictly exact. What's happening is that when block propagation is slow, in effect all miners are selfish mining each others, and perverse incentive start to creep in. So it helps on that front. It doesn't help if some miner is purposefully selfish mining.
> Isn't it possible to simply scan the script code without running it to count how many times this opcode is used and require an adequate fee before running it ?

It is possible.
The utxo being spent needs to have special properties to not crash the node (namely being in the proper cache level).
Friends don't let you down when you have chirurgical complications.
ABC do not accept money that would put it in a position where this is a problem.

No. IOT is mostly hype.
If you know of an easy way to do it, patches are welcome.
Good question. Not falling for it is a good first step.
Great work. Thanks.
It's slow to validate.
Thanks.
Waiting for you patch.
No, the problem is who's doing the work ?
OP makes numerous point. Many are false (like 1. There's simply no use case for this functionality, when we know multiparty contract being 80bits security is not enough), dishonest (3. compare cashaddr with prefix to a legacy address without prefix), or simply show lack of understanding (8. ECC guarantee a lower bound in term of error detection that regular checksum do not).

It's fine if OP doesn't like cashaddr, but none of what's presented is very solid, or even come anywhere close to the risks caused by sending coins on the wrong chain.
I will add, as a dev, if you see you aren't going to make it in time, please, please, please, raise a flag. Quite often, things turn bad not because the estimation is wrong, but because it wasn't flagged early enough to course correct.
That where the whole green logo idea come from...
Thanks.
I'd add that, even if the article was correct (it's not) it is so far removed from the critic of sm that was made by csw that it could hardly be considered as a validation of that critic.
Nowhere. CSW has an habit of making big claims that never lead anywhere. Remember something huge was coming in january ? Or that a sdk was comming ? This continuous cheering of empty statement is somewhat ridiculous and make us looks like idiots. Don't get sucked in.
Well, they don't pretend to be after equality. That's refreshing.
In a cryptographic sense, true, they can do this and they did.

In a moral sense, it is clear cut. If you lend your car to me, would you find it acceptable that I sell it and give you back your money after 2 month ?

In fact they created a taxable event for their users in many jurisdictions, so they may find their ass in court.
I got nothing against L2. Simply that it must not come at the cost of degraded L1. Any L2 tech that do not degrade L1 is welcome as far as I'm concerned.

As for specific plan, we want to fix malleability which will help L2. It is just not the #1 item on the roadmap.
Honestly, I have enough on my plate with the coding side of things :) the good news is that everybody can help to promote the project, and a lot of people are doing great things. If you have any idea how to promote Bitcoin Cash, don't wait to get permission, just go for it !
BCC is used in more places than BCH at this point in time. The ticker do not matter, but consistency does, especially for less newer users.
Here, have an upvote.
I oppose the 75% discount. But I'm willing to take it if that's what unlock the situation and allows to get bigger blocks. It's a compromise, you don't get everything you want. It's bad but I don't think it'll kill Bitcoin. The points mentioned above are much worse in my opinion.
Andrea spent a fair amount of time selling SegWit as a scaling solution so I'm not sure how it is off topic.
I have a few.

Can Segwit fixes problem caused by the malleability attack such as the one ran by James Hilliard from BitClub recently ?

Another one:

If I want to have a LN network with 10M users and allow payments up to $1000 . How much capital needs to be locked in channels ?

One more:

In the context of Segwit2x, what's the incentive people who do not want big block have to follow the chain once segwit already activated ?

An interesting one:

Considering there are 15M UTXO. If everybody start moving their coin to SW adresses and no other transaction occurs, how long becofe the UTXO set is made of SegWit addresses (and so we get the full benefit of segwit) ?

Again:

Considering any clients do not support segwit, activating it will concentrate leverage into the hands of these which support it, meaning mostly core as far as mining is concerned. Isn't reducing the diversity of implementation a systemic risk (meaning, if a bug is discovered, impact will be greater).

Finally:

How many people has he met who said they'd like to use bitcoin, but aren't sure because of the lack of Schnorr signatures ?
I'm not aware of any. But his last business definitively bite the dust: https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-mining-developer-spondoolies-shuts/
This ^

What recently happened to BU could happen to any software. There are ways to reduce the likelihood of it happening, but there are no ways to produce software without bugs, including this kind of bugs, and anyone who say otherwise is a liar.

The best way for the ecosystem as a whole to protect itself is to not rely on a single one implementation. This way, when a bug is discovered in one of them, the whole system is not at risk.

I'd put monoculture as the biggest systemic risk behind failure to increase the block size.
You can't compromise with these that do not wish to compromise. They are doing it now because they are backed against a wall. The instant they aren't backed against the wall anymore, you get back to square one.

There was opportunities to compromise. They signaled they don't wanted to. 
Because I was paged here are some thought. What greg is talking about is that BU, by default, do not check signature for transactions in a block older than N blocks.

Attack 1 can work for some time, but isn't sustainable and not really a threat, greg say's so himself.

Attack 3 is not a threat anymore. BU used to base this check on timestamp, but now it does so on block height, so this attack vector is gone. Contrary to greg's claim, BU takes security seriously and the code greg complain's about was never released.

The most interesting is Attack 2. Before I adress this, I like to point out that soft fork segwit suffer from an identical problem and greg do not seems to have any problem with it, so that should tell you all you want to know.

Attack 2 recuire a majority hashrate to do a huge reorg that spend old coins with invalid signatures. This assume that a majority hashrate is hostile, assumption under which bitcoin is not secure to begin with, but as it creates an incentive to misbehave, why not ? As it turns out, what signature check are skipped is configurable, so some nodes will still reject the reorg, and, in practice, you'd see a huge alert about the reorg and people rejecting it very quickly.
It is.
It is clear that Core has no intention to deliver.
BU's position is that market will decide.
> cleverly crafted code

This myth must die. The bitcoin code is badly engineered.

Thanks for you efforts. Better communication with the Chinese community could improve things quite a lot. Your work is very valuable, please keep it up ! 
Not sure why you are downvoted, this is true. However, 90% of the ecosystem is running the same client, so bitcoin is clearly not immune to this kind of bugs.
So, the business model is to create a quota rent, and then try to benefit from the rent.
I've seen no such data, and every time I asked for a source, I was direted to doc that absolutely do not support that claim.

The whole damn thing looks like a reinvention of Xthin for the sake of NIH syndrome and there is no evidence so far that it is any better.
You should stop spamming Bitcoin with your coffee and start spamming VISA. That'll show them !
That's a very elaborate way to say you want to steal and destroy other's property.
It is completely false. A dev do not need to be a specialist on every part of the system, and realistically cannot be. The team needs to have these knowledge, and finding such team shouldn't be that hard.
Reminder of what Mike Hearn said on forks:

https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-consensus-and-forks-c6a050c792e7
Core is not finished unless miners abandon it.
You can go through bubbles and crashs when you know the basics are solids. Now we can't be sure the basic are solid and will remain solids.
Maybe you can read NOW's website.
Yes, static if makes tool harder to write. But come on, this is C++ here, tooling is already horribly complicated to write, and I don't think an extra bucket of water in the ocean is going to change much.

You get old when you stop learning. Until then, consider yourself a kid.
If you create a petition to class as terrorist a group by ignorance, that IS malice.
The voting system seems to be primarily a way for the leadership to deflect taking responsability.

For example, there was a buip required to support bch (in fact, two, one for the flag day activation, and one for continued support after it failed to become the majority chain) yet apparently, bsv can be supported and require a buip not to be supported.

The reality is that the leadership decides whatever it wants, and when the times come to take responsibilities for bad decisions, they turn around and blame whoever raised the concern for not proposing a buip and/or point that a buip is going to be voted on.
Turning a blind eye has consequences. This is a feature, not a bug.
Never join a community of which the leadership lacks integrity.

But having integrity is not enough. In fact, it is irrelevant if you are willing to promote others who clearly have none. They'll damage the project durably, and, if you don't react soon enough and/or strongly enough, they will get rid of you.

Both Gavin and Roger fell for this trap. This discussion also tells me the community still isn't very good at detecting and avoiding it.
Nobody said that Roger did not have integrity, so I'm not sure how this is relevant to the point raised.
It is the reason why abc exists at all. Both freetrader and myself contributed to BU before.
This is what the page shows at this time: https://archive.ph/wgnsh
You are confusing simple and easy. Simple is rarely easy.
Yes, we do one every fork. The checkpoint is now 180+ block deep, so unless you plan to do a 180 block deep reorg, it changes nothing for you.
The whitepaper doesn't say anything about script, opcodes or transaction ordering, so up to you to decide.
That's  nice claim you got here. Care to share a source for it ?
Any coin that touches a replay protected coin becomes replay protected. Most of the coins in circulation will become protected real quick.
Actually, it almost is but not quite. It is similar to ABC, however.

Happy hunting for the differences.
Then you get permissionned mining.
Computer science, and read book on economics suchas "economics in one lesson"
It obfuscate amount using cryptographic assumption that are not as good as the one made in bitcoin generally. If there is a bug in that part of the code, it is not fixable and the whole chain is toasted.
To the contrary, I think it is important to stick to schedule. A last minute schedule change would only add more chaos to the situation. People are building on top of Bitcoin Cash, so they need the situation to be predictable.

Asking for all the plan to be changed at the last minute is highly unprofessional, and should only occur if there is a **major** issue with the current course of action.
It's up. Sorry for that.
You can shard graphene or any other fast block relay method just fine by sending several packets with only a range of the transactions. These are also not consensus dependent and can be changed in the future easily.
The reason is to make it work as a soft fork.
None of this is accidental.
It doesn't change anything about pre-consensus. I'm just worried about seeing one more thing that degrades 0-conf security pulled in.

It is possible to do query of the kind "do you consider txid A valid ?" that do not provide any information about A. Such queries can be used to get an idea of the validity of A, without requiring A to be propagated in the case most nodes consider it invalid.
It indeed does make it easier to exploit differences in miner policies to do double spend.
They don't have to do the same - in fact right now ABC uses compact block and BU uses XThin as fast block propagation techniques. But this generally not a desirable state of affairs as propagation of blocks between BU and ABC nodes is inefficient as a result.

We established communication channels with BU to make sure this kind of things do not happen in the future and the way BU decided to proceed with graphene is a huge fuck you to all the work that has been done on that front. This is NOT how successful protocols are designed in any industry, and I have to admit my patience for unprofessional actors such as BU or nChain is declining rapidly. We are trying to do solid engineering that the big block movement has lacked so far (sorry to point where it hurts, but between the big block testnet forking and numerous BU/classic zero days, I don't think it's an unfair qualification), but the headline oriented development that these two groups are adopting is creating an inordinate amount of work for us and do not benefit us in any way.
To be the devil advocate, they cornered the devellopement because they had better execution. Say what you want about what they are trying to build, they are damn effiscient at it.

I wish more in the bitcoin cash crowd would understand this.
So I'm not quite sure what happened. Most likely someone tried, and failed to hack my account, which triggerod some alarms on twitter's side.
Bitcoin ABC supports HD wallet now.
CashAddr was done with industry consultation. Industry consultation doesn't mean yelling on reddit, but actually go talk to bitpay, coinbase and other big player to figure out what their problems are, and come up with solutions.
I'm not working for free, I got a sponsorship. But effectively we had little budget until recently, so no ability to hire more people.
It scales n*log(n). XThin as well. That's because both use bloom filters.

I noticed at some point that the discussion wasn't making progress. As the deadline got closer, pressure got higher. Jonald and few others came up with the idea to have some 3rd party evaluate proposals. I wasn't super sold on the idea at first, because that would push the date forward, but that seemed the right thing to do as we couldn't find an agreement.

At that time I already asked bitprim to help me do some real world tests so they got looped in to test the 2 other main proposals. I'm not sure how nChain ended up being involved, but at the end it doesn't matter as they both ended up with similar conclusions: wt-144 perform sligtly better than cw-144 in the happy case, but also has more unknown when it come to attack surface. Note that unknown doesn't mean necessary that it's insecure, just that we'd have to spend more time studying the implications to be sure. It was deemed that wt-144 wasn't performing sufficiently better to either take the risk of rolling it out as this, or the risk of delaying action.

Jonald talked with bitprim and nChain for the most part. When they got back to him then he got back to me and at this point, the decision was made. I told him that we should make sure that Niel and Tom are told about these results before the decision is made public. Then Jonald published the statement.
There are numerous things that could have been done better. At the end of the day, signaling mechanism and alike won't fall from the sky. BIP9 could serve as a base, but isn't really adapted for hard forks.

If we have a signaling mechanism for HF, then I'd support using it the next time we do a HF. If nobody builds it, then it won't be used for the next HF because it won't exist.
For the most part, it is zawy12's . My part is just to use a dual window and make the slow one sticky, which improves stability.

Nobody did that, so I'm not sure how that relevant to anything. Greg thinks everybody does this, but that says more about his delusion than about what anybody is doing.
There are several way you can encode the same transaction and it affect transaction id. This means the node need to remember not only the content of the transaction, but also the specific way it was encoded.
I hope we can make it happen before the end of 2017, but there are a lot of moving parts that I can't control on that one, so I can't promise.
The btcforks slack is a good place: https://btcforks.signup.team/
There is also a forum that has opened recently on https://forum.bitcoincash.org/ . It's very new, we'll see what comes out of it.
Well, we already unlocked it, didn't we ? We have a big block chain and a segwit chain. Hard fork is the best cure against paralysis.
I don't have that many thought about nChain to be honest. This is a relatively new actor in the space and they'll need to build trust with the community over time. I want to see more before I can have a more definitive opinion on the matter.

No, green is the color of the USD. pounds are not greens, euros are not green, yens are not green. USD is probably the most controlled and manipulated currency, and its notes are not even great. Everywhere else in the world, you can pass a note to the washing machine and get it in one piece at the end.
I bet it takes more than 3 month :)
What's new:

 - The GUI has been updated to be branded as ABC.

 - The wallet has been updated to use replay protected transaction by default after the fork.

 - An issue in the network code was fixed. In some cases, this issue could lead to a crash.

 - Various other smaller improvements.
I and /u/ftrader are behind this. Originally, Jihan Wu proposed to do UAHF and, because I liked the idea, decided to implement it.

CSW did not originate the idea. As far as I know he is sympathetic to it, but he is not driving this project.
That's some super cool initiative from BU. I love it.

It shows that the team is focused on solving user's problem. If running a node is too hard/too expensive, then this is a solution to make it simpler/cheaper.

Good job BU.
That's all you need to know. He is moving the spec toward what the UASF crowd wants. Crowd that has no intention of activating the HF part of Segwit2x. As far as I can see, Garzik is being played, and we'll have two coins in 3 month, except both will have segwit.

Yes, P2SH wasn't anyonecanspend.

EDIT: to expand: either Segwit get little adoption (see Litecoin case) and the attack isn't profitable, or Segwit gets a LOT of traction and the attack becomes profitable.
SegWit is BIG. This will take time before other clients catch up.
While you have a point, the main alternative implementation also has a pretty bad bug allowing the attacker to DoS the system, causing unpredictible confirmation time and high fees. Until this bug is fixed, switching is unwise.
That's false. Many were ready to compromise and were happy with the hk agreements. It was rejected by core. Going from there, it is just good manners to reciprocate. You just can't negociate with people who don't want to. At best you will fail, at worse you'll be screwed. 
> **M**ow... just **m**ow!!

FTFY
I'd be happy if the whole crowd could move to LTC and left the BTC space.
Yes, timestamp are generally not reliable. A block count would ensure some level of security, but, based on timestamp, it is hard.

Probably not that big of an issue in practice, but I wish this wasn't merged in that form.
Zander is right. There was a guy at scaling bitcoin in milan who did a studyon this. His conclusion was that segwit discount isn't suffiscient to have the claimed effect as output size aren't big enough.
In real life, the super vilain is a chump nobody cares about.
No. Satoshi left way before core existed.
They are also paying troll to mess with us.

Many of these miners talk as if they HAVE to grow the block size to the limit. 8Mb is too fast ? Do they expect to hit that limit ? If so, they are in the small block camp with core. If not, their argument makes no sense at all.
You completely missed the point. It doesn't matter what the regulation is. More regulation means more cost to comply, and big corp can absorb these costs while smaller actors can't.

That's a classic. Everybody understand how bad the governement is in their daily lives. Noboby goes to the dmv and come back telling everybdy how great of an experience it was. Nobody is eager to go through the TSA check. Nobody expect any administration to do anything fast.

Yet, there is this belief that somewhere, somehow, the governement is doing good. In fact it is doing so much good that all the pain it causes is worth it.

You can never see or experience it, you just have to believe !
I can tell you from first hand experience: it is going to fail. Then the failure is going to be blamed on the market and there will be a "need" for even more governement to fix this. You never get out of it.

To the contrary, the BSV split is a symptom, not a cause. Lack of focus and lack of rational investment in infrastructure.

On both front, BSV is, almost caricaturaly so, extremely commited on these fronts.
You can use gandi.net
Going from 94% to 97% is a 50% drop.
Hashrate on SV went from roughly 3.5EH/s to about 5 EH/s when BMG joined.

Yes, they were doing it at maybe 2EH/s, which is enough if you expect a large burst at first then things to calm down.

Hi :)
Yes, it is not entropy that is directly from the DAG, and this is why there is no point letting the nodes wander in these directions.
All of this is 100% political and 0% technical.
Technically, yes. Considering the current environement, doubtful.
What does it tell you that I can make that post ?
Not only could, but does right now and has for more than a year.
Sure.

His definition of turing completeness is that it can compute "any computable number". It's not even wrong, it's nonsense. How do you define "any computable number" ? A number that can be computed ? By a Turing machine ? Circular reasoning at its best.

On miner incentive, CSW completely ignore that miners are diversified into BTC. The model he base his reasoning upon is once again, nonsense. He conclude that part saying that everything in bitcoin is signed, except miner do not sign their block.

Thrid question he starts off with the small world claim. He fail to demonstrate how this was measured in his paper on the matter - paper which failed peer review. Someone claimed to have been able to reproduce the measurement, but as it turns out, that person measured BTC by mistake, and the assumption made were dubious. But even if that were all true that BCH is a small world - which it might actually be - small world network do not have the property csw claims they do have.

"One point, such as the lightning network". Once again, this is not even false, because doesn't mean anything. LN is not a point. He might as well say "The road is a banana".

Next question, he doesn't seems to understand the difference between exponential and Poisson. He then go on saying block fast propagation is of major importance, which everybody knows since forever. First time in the interview when he says something true. Problem is, he then goes to say miner should use a server like a xeon phi to validate block, but it's actually faster on a i9 these days. If you want to throw money at hardware to improve the perfs, you need to have software - and datastructure that distribute well over that hardware. He also assumes that a miner wants to have its block propagated as fast as possible, which is actually not true for large miners - and this is why all miner use techniques such as spy mining nowadays.

Next question, about SM. He misses completely the important part of the paper to focus on some details. He send go on with propagation model but his model is wrong as it only consider hops (imagine, that's not because there are direct flight from Paris to HK and London that it takes the same time to go to HK or London from Paris. Same goes for internet packets). His description of the behavior of the SM is wrong. His understand of gamma is also ludicrous, gamma=0 by definition means SM never ahead of the honest miner. In real life, gamma=0 is impossible because the system is distributed.

He then explain that SM has an impact on first seen rule for transaction. One again, the road is a banana. He ten goes on to explain that a SM negatively impact its capability to propagate block, and he is correct. What he doesn't understand is that the SM also negatively impact the propagation of other's block even more, which benefit the SM because mining is a zero sum game once difficulty adjusts.

He then goes on into negative probability, a topic on which he's been laughed out of the door numerous time, even by the author of papers he tried to quote on the matter. They are a math trick, just like imaginary number are used in electronic, but at no point in time you can measure an imaginary voltage in an electronic board.

What we can notice is that the only time CSW was able to say something right - a grand total of one in a 20 mins video - he was unable to draw the proper conclusion from it anyways. As this has been going on for more than a year now, and because of the volume of bullshit he is able to produce, we can qualify his presence as a DoS on the scientific community in that space.

No, we won't debunk any stupid claim CSW is making, just like we won't debunk any stupid claim he's making. Competent people's time is scarce.
The argument that we shouldn't improve one thing because it reduces the incentive to do another thing is fallacious.

It was clear when core devs told us that we must not increase the block size because it reduce the incentive for network participant to do batching/segwit/ln. It is just as clear when people tell us we must not improve block propagation because it reduces the incentive for miners to strongly connect. (in addition, it really doesn't because B has no incentive to relay A's block to C, so relying on that behavior is dangerous for a miner regardless).

You are correct on your understanding of thearticle as far as I can tell.
This is *VERY* hard to change.
Yes it does, and yes it does help double spend, either via rogue miner or via abuse of miner's policies discrepancies. Because these can happen at any point in time during the 10 minutes, the feature has the interesting properties that it helps detect double spend attempts, while also making it more likely than they succeed.

Making the PoW depends on the block content is a non starter as SPV can't validate PoW anymore.

But you can pick block at the same height based on timestamp accuracy, tht ensures gamma = 0 as the seflish cannot guess when the honest miner is going to find a block.
Yes.
CSW has shown serious lack of understanding of distributed systems, such as the flp impossibility.
There is not much to read. People pumping and pumping and not doing the work required for it to happen.
Because if nobody is doing the work, the work doesn't get done.
To be clear, this has been on the table for a long time, but if you dig in the codebase you'll notice that it's not easy at all to get it to work again - early version of bitcoin had this feature.

What you are proposing is not a soft fork. It is done that way for very good reasons. I told you so 3 time already. You clearly don't know as much as you think you know and you are so sure you are right that you aren't considering any of it.

As for degree or whatever, no idea.
Yes it is. Classic and BU tried to do a fork bringing everyone along. UAHF, implemented by ABC, wants to do a clean split as it is clear that this is going to be contentious no matter what.

Because of this, it implements replay protection that BU and classic do not implement. Note that there will be a BU-UAHF edition coming relatively soon, so if you prefers running BU rather than ABC, you'll have the option to do so. I'm not sure what are classic's plan.
For P2SH you need to have a preimage. So you need the person to spend from the address to make it happen, and even then it is a double spend, so you have a 50/50 chace of making it happen.

For SegWit, the addresses are anyone can spend so indeed, both are very different and people comparing the 2 are trying to score political points.
If miner go rogue, they can do damage, but they cannot steal coins. With SegWit they can. I don't think they'll do it because I don't think there will be suffiscient SegWit adoption for it to be profitable. However, if we trust the models used to predict SW give a 1.7x capacity increase, then this is definitively profitable. Either way, it's not good.
Bait and switch.
That's not how it works.
The mathematical lower bound for fund that need to be locked in channels is

2 * maxPayementAmount * userCount

And can be achieved via 2 topologies: One giant hub and everybody having a payment channel to that hub, and everybody in a giant circles with channels open with both neighbor.

Depending on the max amount we are willing to route, amount having to be locked in get preposterous real fast. For instance, taking a market cap of $20B and 10M users (current network scale), locking 100% of the coins into LN would impose a maximum amount of $1000 . This is a mathematical limit, actual number will be much smaller in practice.

There are some use case that are well served by LN, but as a replacement to onchain scaling, it's not even close to being realistic.
Morale is how you win.
This is nothing specific to BU.  Reorg happens on the network today. Blocks are orphaned and life goes on.
There is variance, so far it's not big news. There are strange things going on right now. BTCC hashrate is evaporating, BitFury is finding an ungodly amount of blocks, BU pools do not seem very lucky right now.

You may want to wait for a day and look on 1000 blocks what's up. Something is going on right now, but hard to know what is actual data and what is noise.

It doesn't saves any block space. SegWit tx are larger than regular tx.
More generally, fast block propagation and secure 0-conf is the same problem down the road. How can miner and Node agree, ahead of time, and with a reasonable incentive to commit, to a given state of the world.

On the other hand, SPV security and sharding are also the same problem - you can see a SPV client as a node processing 0 shard.

Actually, the code could be written in a more functional manner, if this is what you like.

        variates[i] = uniform(0.0, 1.0);

Could for instance be written as:

Do you think people will store an ever growing amount of data for free ? Pruning is already a thing and the more you store in the blockchain, the more pruning you'll get. There is no such thing as people storing an arbitrarily large amount of data forever.

If some piece of data is of no interest to anyone, then getting rid of it is the right thing to do.
They are good guys and definitively serious about privacy. Try it out and see if it fits your level of expected privacy.
BMG and coingeek hashrate is nowhere to be seen, so you can bet he is doing something. And at this point this is clearly an attack.
Benchmark shows that it is in the ballpark of 0.5% so absolutely not.

In addition, it make parallelisation easier, which should be a great benefit at scale, as well as enable techniques to propagate blocks using way less data, which is also very beneficial at scale.

It's a no brainer.
> This leads me to believe he's a shitty developer/cryptographer

He is.

He also has high persuasion capabilities.
Testnet for bch nov, 15 upgrade has been running for more than two month now.

There is no public testnet for bsv.
"It can cause loops and recursion" didn't work.
"it's patented omg!" didn't work.
"It will make bitcoin illegal!" still didn't work.
"It breaks the economics of bitcoin" except it doesn't.
"It's unecessary cause you can do it with a 1MB script" was stupid.

They are throwing everything they can think of at the wall to see what sticks. When that happens, remember rick's post: http://falkvinge.net/2017/05/01/blockstream-patents-segwit-makes-pieces-fall-place/
cryptorebel made it all happen. You can check the commit history, he's by far the largest contributor.

Ho wait, no, he did jack shit.
Hi,

I contacted them about this a few days ago and they got it back. They can stay on there :)
Negative Gamma.
The most important part of that proposal is to ensure the block size and transaction count is covered by PoW. Removing the block size in the absence of this opens various DoS vectors. Another one is that the timestamp in the header is limited to 32 bits, so it'll be rocky in 2038.

There are also benefit that you can shard everything based on txid in a static fashion. That's not an immediate problem, but by the time this is a problem, it won't be possible to change it.
Absolutely, this is why there is a tesnet up woth all the feature to activate in November. You can find details here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wg2ciYk7efDFpUD9qIz2Q9-Qp4H8i0Io8ThdDbGdyPU/edit
The ABC roadmap mention elements that affects other parties in the ecosystem. We also plan to fix some of these bottlenecks - in fact some should be fixed in 0.18.2 - but bottleneck that are due to how the software works internally are not n the roadmap you mention.

> What is this bottleneck?

The bottleneck for 22-25MB block is due to how fast transaction can be accepted in the mempool. BU has an experimental fix for this. ABC also has something on the work.

> Does the Nov. update fix this bottleneck (and any others)?

The Nov upgrade fixes bottleneck that come much later. Fixing the one at 22MB or so do not require a consensus change so we don't need to wait for November.

> What do you foresee as the next (blk size-wise) bottleneck once the ~20MB blk issue is resolved? And is this also addressed in the Nov. or next May plans?

There are other major problems, such as the block template generation and block propagation. CTOR and graphene helps on block propagation. Template generation is not a consensus change, so it doesn't require a fork.

You may want to read that article for more details: https://www.bitcoinabc.org/2018-09-07-bitcoin-abc-and-the-block-size-limit/
I do not think this question makes a lot of sense. Hashrate follow price. The market decide. But considering there has been no release of SV yet, that their pool is not operational and that they have an habit on not delivering on their promise, I suspect BSV will get close to 0% of the hashrate, if it happens at all.
It gives you DoS vectors. But in term of capacity, nothing indeed.
https://www.bitcoinabc.org/2018-05-07-incident-report/
Thanks.
Mostly everybody wants it. BU merged an implementation, however, there was no spec and no discussion with dev of other implementation, so it's very likely they end up with something incompatible with what everybody elses ends up doing. Expect a lot of drama on social media when that happens, accusation from Andrew et al. But really, it's all very predictible.
It has zero impact on zero conf.
Sate granted monopolies are anything but capitalism.

Roger supported segwit2x . When that effeort failed, he started supporting bitcoin cash.
Aparently not. Theydid not update for the fork and wasted a day of mining.
Yes, and this is why the graph for CPU stops in 2010. The curve definitively is flattening.
You can't test security. However, we are eagerly warting for your code reviews.
Going in straight line through the earth,  you need more than 40ms to reach the other side.
This is already illegal. No need for new regulations.
There are good people who are willing and that we could hire right now. We lack funding to get them onboard.
Our team and support is quite thin. We really do have about 3BCH in the name of ABC. I work on this paid by a research grant. There are two other people paid to work on this (shay and matias) plus a few volonteers contributing on their free time. Before the donation thing, me and shay where paying for servers and other infra costs from pocket.
> Any idea why the reactivation of old OP_CODES was not discussed on the bitcoin-ml mailing list? 

Yes. Tom essentially killed the ML by using it as a propaganda tool. It's pretty much dead now and micropresident created work groups to create a new place for this to happens.

> Many of them are good changes with benefits, like Cashaddr, but they come out of nowhere and get implemented almost immediately with little time for feedback. 

This is blatantly false. CashAddr is an evolution of a BUIP I proposed on Jan, 2017 (see https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip045-unified-addresses-format-for-buip037.1725/ ). People decide to ignore proposal until there is so much shit all around they can't pretend it doesn't smell anymore. I tried to have these thing happen in BU and classic for months.

> The surprise announcement of your partnership with Counterparty Cash is another "act first and everyone else can deal with it later" behavior.

I partner with anyone who want to cooperate to build something useful on Bitcoin Cash. That would be retarded not to. I cannot partner with people that do not cooperate.
As mentionned on twitter, I'm glad this was chosen using a solid methodology involving a/b testing, and not the new slogan of the week until next week. Because it is, right ?
I was presented in situ as abc lead dev. There is always a balance between simplification and oversimplification that is not easy to find.
Bitcoin doesn't have a scaling problem, only self inflicted wounds. Bitcoin cash has no intention of behaving the same way.
Come on you are better than this. Yes privacy helps criminals, because it helps everybody.
There is another more important value: reciprocity.
You can't fix typos in tweets :(
Well ideally, you'd like have this address under "mom" in your wallet and never see it again. Like a phone number on a recent smartphone. You input it once and lever look at it again. But at this point, it becomes a UX thing, and not really my area anyway. Wallet devs, we need you :)
Good work guys !
If Tone Vay predict $1 , then I'll get some.
> either/or

It is definitively either/or . Changing the address format is extremely costly to the ecosystem. Every single wallet needs to be updated. Every single merchant software needs to be updated. Every block explorer needs to be updated, etc...

And during the transition time, there is a lot of confusion as some wallet will support the new format and other won't. There are things that can be done to mitigate the confusion during the migration but that's limited. You propose one solution and that's great. However, implementing these solutions is also a tax on the ecosystem.

None of this is specific to BCC. For instance, Open Bazar supported the bech32 format way before core did. When segwit activated, they started using it, but other wallet did not understand it and they got complaints from confused users.

There are problems with the current address format. Most of them are not deal breakers but one is: the format is not extensible. That means that whatever future feature is introduced in the future will require a new address format. This is what you see with bech32 and segwit. That is a bad situation. If you want to change the address format, you need to make sure it is for an address format that is extensible, such as it can support future features. This is the only way to ensure the cost is amortized.

If we don't do this, we will need to change the address format again in 6 month or a year when we add some new feature, and that's highly undesirable.

There are other reason why the current address format is not great. These reason are not as important and wouldn't justify changing the format, but, if we are going to change it anyway, these should definitively be taken into account to get the most bang for the buck. Here are some of the problems with the current address format (this is not exhaustive):

 - Computing addresses is actually expensive - and that's a problem in some uses case, mainly in merchant software (it required repeated big num division + compute a 256 bits cryptographic checksum).

 - Addressees do not encode efficiently in QR codes.

 - The checksum do not provide guarantee other than probabilistic - for instance it could guarantee that if you miss one character, it is going to be detected.

Obviously, as mentioned not of these is worth the cost of changing the address format on its own. But if you are going to change the format anyway, these should be fixed.
I think he is referring to utxo comitment, allowing a node to operate without knowledge of the full history.
He has accused numerous other people of the same thing. As far as i know, it was baseless every single time.
Yup, but indeed, the site could be improved.
I'm not sure it makes sense to use all the four at once. But pick the one you like, install it and run it. It'll take some time to sync the blockchain, and after that, you are all set.

The 8MB limit is a configuration, as such it can be raised without requiring people to upgrade in urgency. However, we'd like to have a mechanism to automatically set the configuration in the future.
Yes, only part of it is done in parallel, and now that it is cached, it's not even the most expenive part.
You can think your adversary is making an error while benefiting from it. There is no contradiction here.
Or maybe there is something called BIP34...
Github issue are a place to get shit done. Not for trolling or discussing. For this, there is reddit.
Denial, name calling and shade throwing is a good indication that he does not.
One is funded by VC, the other by bitcoin. Tough choice, indeed.

It is resilient because nobody care enough about it to attack it. It is mostly irrelevent in the grand scale of things.
Not signaling bit1 will force UASFers to fork themselves off.
As I said many times: if you have no plan B, you have no plan A.
No this is addressing the problem that some people face, namely that running a node is too expensive and/or complicated.
You don't fire people by giving them what they want.
BitClub attack on the network for instance, illustrate it.

https://medium.com/@bithernet/bitclub-why-are-you-doing-malleability-attack-now-6faa194b2146

Obviously, the guy who ran this attack is now making the segwit2x spec, so there is that...
I'm a contributor to LLVM, I would consider this good code.
Exactly ! Let's give them what they want, that'll show them ! 
We will have 2 to 4 time the capacity. Block on the other hand will get up to 8MB. That's the #1 reason segwit is shit.
What's the pool stance on uahf ?
Considering monero predates this patent, it's probably not enforceable.
While core and BU seems convinced the other is their worst ennemy, really, core is the best advocate for BU and vice versa.
And yet, user experience got worse, proving it was the wrong thing to work on.
There is no quadratic scaling time. There is quadratic hashing, which is only a problem if you want to do very large transactions. It doesn't impact the number of transaction that can be processed.

As to maleability, there are proposals, namely buip037 and flex trans they address quadratic hashing as well). However, this is not as much of a problem as the block size. 
Do you have a source ?
What you are missing is that there is a very strong incentive for miner to align with the majority, or they'll lose a lot of money mining worthless blocks. If BU gets to more than 50% of hashrate, you can expect other actors to switch very quickly. It is unlikely that miner decide to trigger BU at 50% hash rate, however, it'd be safe to do so at 75% if the event is planned properly.

SW is more tricky because it is a soft fork, and therefore needs a much larger acceptance among miner to be activated, or it risk to cause user to lose coins. If miner fail to enforce SW, then all SW coins become spendable by everybody (but most likely the miner themselves). As a result, SW needs 95% of the hashrate to activate.
I hope that helps you to understand who's escalating the situation and why it is still not resolved.
I think you missed the point so let me unpack.

If A is awful software and A is 99% B, then there is a good chance that B is at least 99% awful.
These people you complain about are also lying to you about segwit. It doesn't solve anything for non segwit utxo.

Quadratic hashing ? Still there.
Maleability ? Still there.

As to capacity increase, it creates an adverserial case of 4MB so it isn't desirable to do it that way.

In addition to this, chosing segwit is chosing to support this team and disaprove of other teams such as bu's or classic. There is no right for segwit to activate. You can just vote with your your hashrate.
1/ They filled the patent a year before dpl was a thing.
2/ this kind of program rely on trust. The capital trust of blockstream is 0 since the HK agreements.
Yes, figuratively. I don't wish anyone to waste ammunition.
Statists gonna state.
> Just prove it instead of making bets about your ability to be able to prove it. You'd be proving it in either case, so why not just prove it in the first place? It's not rocket science Greg. 

Same as for Craig, because he can't.
He is projecting.
I read that with great interest, but I think I have better under my belt. I have been furiously writting about this, but english is not my first language, so it takes time.

The general idea is to use a new data structure instead of the merkle tree, which allow for proof of presence and absence from the root hash. Knowlegde of the content of the tree is only requried to produce a proof, everything else can be done from the proof.

This can be used to shard block processing, but also to shard the utxo set.

EDIT: and here we go for the first step int he explanation: http://www.deadalnix.me/2016/09/24/introducing-merklix-tree-as-an-unordered-merkle-tree-on-steroid/
They see themselve as under attack and in need of extreme measures to defend themselves.
I've talked with enough of them, including in private, to know they trully think this is the best way forward.

According to some, they are dipshit.
The joys of gregonomics.
You don't understand how burden of proof work, do you ?

Now, if you have a description of a testing protocol associated with data, post it.

Hint: an email archive or an faq do not constitute a test protocol and data. Now, maybe it is in one of these email, but considering you've been unable to point at one, cocam's razor tell me there is none.
That is not testing results, just a bunch of emails. Just like Craig, everytime you don't provides proof of your claims you look less serious and increase the burden of proof you face.
These that have no minimum wage ?
Or you use a lock of a week or so with a rolling windows, in which case you are left with a full week to check. Obviously, the downside, is a full week settlement. In both case, that sounds like paradigm shifting payment technology !
Or just having less veterans. Sending men killing each other all over the Globe doesn't strike me as very desirable to boot.
Can you honestly say you support that right while going for censorship, ddos, threats to go to court and backroom deals ? I don't think so.

You can say it. It doesn't mean everybody has to like it.
There is no need for a risky change, and this is why the limit should be raised. Bitcoin effectively always ran as if there were no limit, and running with satured blocks IS a limit.
Yes, yet I understand. When you struggle to find food, you have more important things to do than considering the opportunity cost of various government policies.
Something has been produced. It is BIP101, and it is already implemented. Everything else is politics.

What do you expect to be implemented by people on this sub ? Obviously it is not mentioned in your post, but let me bet : you have no fucking idea, you just wanted to sound smart.
The face of dr Kathleen, it says it all :)
That's democratic socialism in practice for you.
They couldn't have brought gun into the venue, whatever the law. It is common practice for venue like concert hall to not let people with weapon get in, including in country that are more permissive.

Look, I'm on your side on the gun debate, but this is not a good case for it. The way you jump on the issue to push the agenda is kind of distasteful, actually.
