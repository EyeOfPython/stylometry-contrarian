Brutally debunked

>But the authors' unfortunate choice of example inadvertently reveals the real issue with this paper. Rather than disrupting prime brokerage, as the authors seem to intend, **the paper’s solution to Bitcoin’s liquidity problem in fact replicates the interbank market**.

-

>The interbank market pools and redistributes liquidity across market sectors, just as Liquid aims to do. And it has key “functionaries," known as broker dealers, whose job it is to maintain market liquidity and **act as gateways to the payments system**. Without a functioning interbank market, transactions can be very slow or even fail, and banks can literally run out of money. Just like cryptocurrency exchanges, in fact.

**Welcome to Bank 2.0 you brainless Core minions and shut up if you talk about decentralization again.**
>Update 4: The original version of this article included "Bcash" in parentheses after "Bitcoin Cash". This has been removed as **Bcash is not part of the official Bitcoin Cash name**.

It reminds me of the former [U.S. housing market crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_housing_bubble). Banks were investing in shitty bonds (CDOs), not knowing what was inside, which lead to the housing market collapse. And now compare it with legacy bitcoin (trading at $14150). 

-

Legacy Bitcoin's current underlying foundation is 

- 1 MB block size, which limits and prices out many users from bitcoin, 
- high and unpredictable fees 
- slow confirmation times
- having now 126000 [unconfirmed txs](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions), 
- a 230 MB mempool, 
- commercial use cases are dying left and right (e.g., Steam),
- and folks are investing into vaporware and  "store of value" coin that only works with centralized entities like exchanges and LN hubs. 

-

**With all the flaws mentioned above, is legacy bitcoin really $14150 worth** 🤨**?**

-

You don't fully control your bitcoins anymore! That's not bitcoin anymore, a **P2P** electronic cash system! We are literally creating new banks here! 

-

IMO, an explosive thing that currently grows.

The last days were amazing: Not sharing information with other client developers, attacking the bug reporter, Toddler's passive aggressive feeling outburst againts the bug reporter, and now copyright infringement accusations. Man... some prominent Core members are very very unsympathetic and whine too much. 
With which banks are you working?
Well... to be more precise, "reality" is an enemy of r/bitcoin mods and for most Core client developers and their astroturfing minions.

True Story!
Tone has no clue what he is talking and parroting what Core/Blockstream preaches. He should have stuck with UASF, a safe harbor for his 5-year-old basement computer.

Doesn't fit with Core/Blockstream's narrative. They prefer astroturfed means like 

-

- "Proof-of-r/bitcoin", 
- "Proof-of-Twitter Polls", 
- "Proof-of-Bitcoin.org" and
- "Proof-of-Adam" with extended narrative control

-

 It's more convenient to transform Bitcoin from P2P electronic cash to a settlement layer.
Otherwise it would give the impression that a select small group of developers (with high Blockstream elements) sets the direction and agenda how Bitcoin evolves. 100 developers sounds more consensus, more decentralized and it sells better to the public.
This has to be translated asap!
It is the fear that Bitcoin Cash can and will overturn their store of value worldview, which is a moderated fairytale story  thanks to astroturfing and censorship. BCH is a store of value and payment instrument at the same time.

I would buy bch to minimize risk. 
/u/Jihan_Bitmain Thanks for supporting Bitcoin and being against censorship. 
-

Of course it's political. It's all about power, control and money. If SegWit doesn't get activated, Blockstream and their offchain buddies have to go back to their "whiteboard" doodling. $75 million won't last long and VCs aren't charity organizations. 

-

If bitcoin scales onchain and is truly competitive, there is apparently the fear that LN will not take off. So basically these guys admit that LN might be not good enough.

-

We had so much innovation and many startups that used Bitcoin onchain. But hey, it's ok for Core to kill/stifle colored coin services, which actually use onchain. What annoys me is selfish behavior  by [Henry et al.](https://twitter.com/Technom4ge/status/830559169161871363) who desperately want SegWit activation to increase their "personal" business portfolio, while verbally dividing and choking the entire community.

-

IMO, LN hubs strongest value proposition is to handle nano payments between machines or paying for something below one cent. These are new use cases! New use cases -> More use of Bitcoin -> Bitcoin value increases.

They literally create new banks 
They don't realize it ... but they are doing free promotions for Bitcoin.com and Bitcoin Cash .... 👌

-

According to Core/Blockstream, VISA level scaling can only happen offchain. Coincidentally, this fits very well with Blockstream's business model to commercialize offchain solutions (development, consulting etc), where the cofounder and CTO Greg is also one of the leading and vocal Core developers. A very  fertile ground for conflict of interest. 

-

The argument that 100 + developers are coding for Bitcoin is true, and according that logic "Blockstream does not control Bitcoin". On the first glance it might be true. **But** a very small group of Core developers also work for Blockstream, who have indeed the [administrative](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-chief-scientist-gavin-andersons-github-commit-access-removed/), [political power and the financial resources](http://imgur.com/a/FlQe6) to determine the agenda how Bitcoin should scale.  

-

Almost all their development efforts are targeted towards Bitcoin offchain. That's why we have full blocks and high fees, which increase the pressure to adopt offchain products. Pretty convenient.

-

So we have two competing layers. Layer one (onchain) is still co-controlled with miners. With layer two (offchain), **miners lose basically their say and have the tremendous risk in being disintermediated** (e.g. PoW change), the risk being out of the Bitcoin business. Alternatively, they mine altcoins as BW and [BTCC](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/772002551336099840) do or plan with Ethereum Classic.

-

At this stage though, there is no product delivered aka [Vaporware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware). Vapoware is a good strategy by incumbents to deter customers (miners) switching software. Switching costs are high due to unreasonable fear of system failure, political maneuvers by agents (BTCC, BitFury) or implicit threats (Core) to cutoff miners from future revenues streams. 

-

In a nutshell: miners like /u/jihan_bitmain, /u/MacBook-air or HaoBTC are in a dilemma and they increase their dilemma with their inactions. In addition, other Bitcoin companies made the mistake not to support a nonprofit development team. If I were Jihan et al., I would test and work with other development teams to have a plan B or an alternative.

-

Though, that changed recently  with Bitcoin Unlimited ($500K funding). The greatest threat to Blockstream is Bitcoin Unlimited. Greg's actions by discrediting BU and intensively arguing with BU developers is an implicit confession that things get tricky.

-

A sad true story.

-
Winning ✌️

A must-read folks! It takes 5 minutes!
After five months of inactions, literally, a sad and predictable story. We will remember.

Bitcoin was meant to give global economic freedom to mankind, which now gets transformed into a new bank system (LN, watch towers et al.) by few and incompetent developers and greedy VCs/lapdogs (Liecoin creator).

**We should not get distracted** 

-

Again, **Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System** 

-

**It is not a payment settlement system for intermediaries**. With Core's roadmap, average users get priced out and have to rely on intermediaries to move value. **We would create new banks!**

-

It is all about scaling on-chain. Core's refusal for years to make modest changes to the block size created this mess of confirmation delays and skyrocketing fees. Bitcoin was supposed to be a fast and cheap P2P payment system for everyone on this planet. It all happened with Blockstream's foundation and their push to move the bulk of transactions, new use cases and their business model off-chain. Colored coin companies created wonderful use cases on-chain, which increased the value of Bitcoin.

-

Furthermore, we have **no guarantee by Core**, its allies (Blockstream, BitFury and BTCC) and minions ([Henry](https://twitter.com/Technom4ge/status/837939137151803392), Tone, Panda, Samsung) would support **a block size increase in the future**. They love fee-markets and payment channels in the future would also fight to settle on-chain. Satoshi itself stated that **free transactions should be possible** until the reward is not sustainable. Heck, the block reward dries up in 2140. 

-

IMO, all bitcoin users should have the ability to make **direct permissionless** Bitcoin transactions. Technology is evolving, BU is evolving. **What Core and its minions are doing is not in the spirit of Bitcoin**. 

-

EDIT: I would argue r/btc is not against off-chain solutions, but do not choke on-chain growth. 

-


Colored coins were such a promising innovation for Bitcoin 2-3 years ago... but it competed with Blockstream's sidechain product.

I am also skeptical about ICOs, which have to create a chain from scratch. ICOs are basically colored coins of today, which would have been anchored on the BTC chain ... it would make BTC more useful and hence more valuable. 

Core/Blockstream stole bitcoin's future! 
 
Charlie's concern for Core/BS is so remarkable, so selfless, so genuine, so authentic. 
The End of Lambos!

>I**n terms of the store of value argument, does it help here that bitcoin isn't that stable, it's not skyrocketing [...] you would think it would maintain value**
Max you are defrauding the public here by not understanding how forks work. Bitcoin Cash shares the same genesis block as legacy bitcoin does.

>However, Keiser severely criticized bitcoin cash, the third most popular cryptocurrency, saying it uses the name of the original bitcoin to earn a buck. He accused it of **plagiarism**.

-

>“Bitcoin cash is an alt-coin that has its fans just like many alt-coins. I don't think anyone who uses bitcoin's name and applies it to an alt-coin like bitcoin cash does is adhering to **acceptable business practices**. In other words, bitcoin's brand is **being stolen** by a competitor that calls itself bitcoin cash and this is **outright fraud** in my opinion, just like it's fraudulent to use Coca-Cola and Nike's name to sell soft drinks or shoes,” said Keiser.

-

Coinmarketcap should also add back the @bitcoin twitter account! It is basically censorship!

**No Blockstream/Core Toxicity!**

 It's based on Sergio's proposal 

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-March/013921.html
**We need a planned hardfork in the future.**

We need to support alternative implementations. It is a myth that Bitcoin Core is decentralized. All major development communication channels are in some way influenced by Blockstream actors and agents. There is no chance for other ideas to get through. Sergio's 2MB proposal was the latest rejection. 

Core doesn't want a hardfork. But hey, they are fine with UASF which is more dangerous and reckless. Honestly, there is nothing left to compromise. 
-

I would say the damage that has been made over the years is higher than one orphaned block: 

-

- Merchants lost confidence
- Users lost confidence 
- Current/Prospective startups lost confidence
- alienating and driving developers to altcoins
- alienating, ridiculing and threatening miners

-

Again, I think the costs and the damage is more than $12K. The user, business, developer and mining community has to act together. Core cannot hide and code in their ivory tower detached from these communities. Otherwise, these communities select alternatives, as it happens with BU. 

-



/u/jratcliff63367:

>This is the same conclusion I came to. **Leave the main chain for moving high value transactions** (think thousands of dollars to millions) and all of **the low value stuff happens on sidechains and bidirectional payment channels**. 

>This is the way to safely scale to infinity and beyond.

Interesting, so we should give up on a **P2P** electronic cash system? Do you realize what you are promoting? Bitcoin was meant to reduce intermediaries. It seems you are ok with it that some special groups introduce intermediaries again .
**This**
If the cost of a product or service is rising (compared to existing ones), something is not working properly. The argument that decentralized services cannot compete with centralized ones is very weak and showing a lack of substantiated arguments. 

I truly believe that (Bitcoin) transactions should have negligible or no fees for end users. Companies have to come up with other value added services on top, or make use of technology that reduces the fee pressure. [RBF](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uphgv/eli5_what_is_rbfreplacebyfee/) is just a symptom of the problem and not the solution for the problem.

Interestingly, we have solutions that can tackle these (fee) problems, but some people prefer the perfect solution instead a good solution. This takes time (especially in decentralized systems) while other innovative services take over by being cheaper and faster.
and the CSO of Blockstream is the source.

Every Bitcoin company contributes in their own way. Circle made a tremendous job to on board and familiarize thousands of new users with Bitcoin, who bought and sold Bitcoins and hence contributed to Bitcoin's growth (until Bitcoin hit the ceiling).

Your Bitcoin contribution is talking, which fulfills its part.
IMO, the best thing what /u/Jihan_Bitmain and /u/MacBook-air can do: follow the steps of KnC miner. Mining Bitcoin Classic is still compatible with Bitcoin Core to a certain threshold. 

-

There is no risk mining in Bitcoin Classic, you still get your Core block rewards. Jihan and others need some kind of leverage, guarantee and be prepared in case Core code is not ready. Not installing SegWit is not enough.

-

If they make the first steps, other miners may join. Sending angry tweets is not going to change anything. Consumer facing Bitcoin firms should also use this window opportunity to send a united message. Startups suffer with the current

It's malicious!
Barry ... now you get a "little" taste what we had to witness the last 3 years  🤔... why miners showed incredible patience with the HK agreement, but  gave up on Adam. 

I'm sorry to say but his job title has no meaning, he probably cannot do any decisions without Greg's consent. Basically  a hostage. Adam is just a business proxy of Greg's will. With Greg's no compromise attitude it is  impossible to find a middle ground. 
I ask myself if some people lost touch with reality. It's like a  mad king in his besieged castle who is surrounded by perceived traitors and plans to "burn them all" aka asking to abandon Bitcoin, change PoW or switch to PayPal.
It baffles me how a for **profit company** interferes so heavily with the  Bitcoin protocol development. There are obvious conflicts of interest. It is actually the root cause of this divide in this community. They want to commercialize 2nd layer solutions, which is fine. But don't take the Bitcoin 1 MB hostage to force and accelerate your business revenue options with BTCC and BitFury.

 Blockstream is not the Red Cross here and miners believe they will develop the holy grail of revenues. What if more transactions happen offchain and via PoS. Why do I need miners then other than as heaters?
Ding ding ding.... we have a winner! 
Nope, 70 days heads up time to fix it and the attack would require significant time to prepare.

Conclusion: The accusations against JJ are overblown.

Have a good day :) 
>if that were true, why were no other implementations made aware? If the vulnerability were "serious" (his words), why then were no other implementations warned by Core? 

**If true**... they are bunch of corporatized spineless pseudo open source developers to harm other Bitcoin clients. Just malicious!

When it comes from Jihan, it's considered to be an attack. Creating a new transaction format to drive transactions to sidechains is normal.  Very normal. 
Right direction!
Vocabulary change is the little sister of changing the narrative that fits your agenda.
To all Bitcoin stakeholders: users, miners, exchanges etc... this should be a very early warning and disturbing incident who could control Bitcoin and change directions. One of the reasons why we need more alternatives like Classic.
There are your **pre-orders**, is just excessive testing :)
Can we have a simple BCH shuffle counter?
Peter, I think to memorialize this for eternity, a quick presentation (powerpoint/keynote) on youtube like Falkenvinge would be very useful. These gold nuggets don't reach the masses and aren't easy to share. 


All endorsements (e.g., Halong Miners, Bitcoin Gold) by Adam Back (Blockstream CEO) -> **failures all the way!**

It would lift Bitcoin Cash to a new level while still functioning for P2P payments : 

-

- apps (loyalty points), 
- services (tickets) 
- companies  (e.g., stocks)
- or entire digital economies 

-

would use Bitcoin Cash satohies (or fractions of it) to anchor their assets on the BCH chain. The more BCH is used for payments or other purposes (e.g., digital asset anchoring)  the more valuable BCH becomes. So good news!

>The major benefit of choosing the Colored Coins protocol is it’s simplicity. By using the Bitcoin blockchain in the most basic way possible (“coloring” satoshis) developers don’t need to handle different currencies to fund transactions or deal with experimental blockchains. Developers can also benefit from the hashing power of the largest and most secure blockchain in the world while also leveraging interoperability with Bitcoin’s ecosystem. This allows the use of Bitcoin standards and tools like hardware wallets, payment API’s, security best practices, exchanges, etc.

The hypocrisy is strong with these guys. Very!

SegWit activation is at risk/delayed, some Core developers and agents are displeased and not willing to compromise (not one millimeter), and now throwing new barbs at miners to transform their investments into hot bricks. 

-

If you take one step back, Core may present the greatest risk to Bitcoin, hijacking it from Satoshi and transforming it to a settlement layer for centralized  2nd layer solutions. In the long run, it becomes easy to  replace the settlement layer and by that the  miners. AKA showing a middle finger to them.

We can conclude that Blockstream CEO and his minions were promoting a scam. He had a good track record so far: 

BS Satellites -> Fail

Lightning  -> failing since 2016

"Branding" is the way how Litecoin solves fundamental problems. 
Trade-off doesn't exist in a Core developers' vocabulary. Result: Bitcoin Cash.
Actually, Blockstream lost relevance. Tone said it himself. No one was visiting Adam's consensus presentation. Sad but a true story. 
Stupid and his desperation speaks through. 

It becomes evident that UASF is increasingly becoming the best marketed train wreck in Bitcoin's history.  I collect all the proud UASF minion pictures for documentation purposes. You should do it too.

Chinese miners should really listen to what other miners say.

IMO, offchain solutions have their place. What I don't like is the **choking of onchain to push your commercial offchain agenda**, and by that moving the bulk of transactions, customer relationships, fund deposits to centralized services. Yes, centralized! This would clearly **harm Bitcoin's decentralized nature** in being P2P.  That is the real story!

-

Our beloved Core minion [Henry](https://twitter.com/Technom4ge/status/853269810876219396) unsurprisingly claims that this sub has no clue about technology. I don't have to know each code line and its nitty gritty details, but others do, who work on other Bitcoin clients.

-

What is relevant to know is 

- who controls the transaction,
- where does the transaction happen, 
- what will be the transactions cost,
- what are the costs to reverse a code (e.g., SegWit)
- and more importantly, who is going to have code authority and freedom to make adjustments. 

-

Blockstream has played well to offer these solutions and they openly and tacitly attack other ideas that compete with their ideas. 

-

The endlessly promoted BS that development is decentralized and no one controls bitcoin does not account the fact that very very few people with Blockstream overlaps decide what gets merged into Bitcoin. 

-

Look what Greg has done: with just one post he basically shot down the UASF bird from the sky.

**Always question the timing of this proposal**.

-

So Andreas predicts two types of Bitcoins. FYI: Bitcoin based on Bitcoin Core client are mined by two large miners: [Bitfury and BTCC](https://coin.dance/blocks/segwit) (+ other negligible, unpredictable and mercenary ones). 

-

This seems ok with small blockers, there is no centralization with just two miners while BitFury is totally closed and VC backed. No problem at all!

-

Andreas preaches decentralization to the community. I hope he speaks up about the centralization risk for Bitcoin based on Core client and with  just two large miners. If not, he tacitly accepts it. 

-

2 MB hard coded/capped market supply (Core) vs market oriented supply of block space (BU).

Anyways, they should first deliver. Some Core developers are very creative what they say and what it means at the end.
Well done Roger! [Best part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-z-zTBHOO8&feature=youtu.be&t=1h5m12s) IMO.
BashCo, you are just very wrong. They have legitimate concerns (read the [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/jgarzik/bitcoin-status-report-onchain-scaling-aug-2016) by Jeff on SegWit).

Secondly, what gives you the right to judge what miners or wallet providers do or don't do. I don't like this elite thinking, and it's not in the spirit of Bitcoin. Meditations and a sabbatical leave would do well to you.

If I may suggest,mentioning 1.7 increase MB is misleading. It's 0.7 MB.
You could say that BitFury, BTCC, Blockstream and others are tools at the protocol level to control/shape Bitcoin and to enable DCG's empire of 2nd layer solutions. DCG has tremendous insider knowledge (product roadmap, deals) to act faster and outmaneuver other Bitcoin firms and VCs. Potentially destroying business models of firms that are not in DCG' portfolio.

So basically promoting the idea of **SegWit first** and "the discussion" (???) about **larger blocks later**. 

-

Do you guys really believe that will happen???? Core demonstrated repeatly  that they don't have the intention to increase the block size. By activating SegWit, miners won't have the same voting rights anymore as they have it now. It shifts the power and control more to Core and Blockstream.

-

I'm not sure if F2Pool (pool operator with no miners on its own ) has thought that through.

If Chinese miners had their own R&D teams or China had more Bitcoin code contributors, the story would look different. 

Blockstream has build a subtle monopol on the Bitcoin code and Chinese miners are reluctant to question Blockstream's code authority. And yes, **Chinese miners consider Core as Blockstream**, otherwise they wouldn't [make a fuss](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=700411.msg13993733#msg13993733) about the Adam individual/president story.

Yes, we know the statements that Blockstream is working for the greater benefit, but their actions speak a different language. Classic people have to engage with the Chinese miners and in the longterm, the western countries have to balance the hashing power.
**"If there is strong community support, the hard-fork activation will likely happen around July 2017"**

>Does it not bother you that someone is using the state (patent law) to gain advantage over other miners and hiding it?


- Many bitcoin firms have applied for patents (e.g., Blockstream, Coinbase)

-

- Efficiency gains: other miners are free to create better mining equipment. Technology gets better. BitFury has its [mining container](https://www.bitmart.co.za/en/product/bitfury-12-petahash-datacenter-solution/)

-

- Many bitcoin firms (software/hardware) act secretly on different levels. They aren't charity organizations.

For me, this is an attack on one specific miner and penalizing for being efficient.   
You cannot change a published paper. You can create a new paper with your name. Otherwise, it would be plagiarism, stealing the work.

We old guys here  are tired to read this over and over again that BS is chocking onchain growth.

**But** it's important to rehash this again and again as more new users visit and subscribe to r/btc.
-

It's honorable that BitPay tries to solve the issue with their own bitcoin client proposal, but the impact is zero. It's looks more like a hobby to keep their developers entertained. 
 
-

The bottom line is this: Bitcoin Core + SegWit is becoming increasingly unlikely. Core minions may believe something else, but if you leave the bubble for one moment, reality looks quite different. It would be a miracle if SegWit gets activated. Many vocal Core developers burned bridges while the other side tried to compromise and waited patiently. I assume Andreas stopped to demo live Bitcoin transactions in front of his audience. Businesses are suffering, getting drowned with support tickets and high fees (of course for Henry no issue). On top of that, prominent Core developers were saying that everything is working fine.  

-

Now Roger gets blamed for blocking SegWit with his gigantic 2.3% global pool hashrate and other miners get verbally assaulted why they don't run SegWit on their machines. Their machines! Apparently, Core minions have short memories and accepting now any radical measure ([UASF](https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-miners-worried-about-a-user-activated-fork-propose-synthetic-fork/)) to kick out miners which don't run SegWit. It's crazy!

IMO, ViaBTC is one of the most helpful, innovative and forward thinking Bitcoin mining pools. ViaBTC's decision to mine Bitcoin Unlimited turned the tables.
So a hard fork is suddenly possible? Stay classy Kyle. 
Some ads to r/btc are needed!

I don't get why Blockstream has to patent it through their for **profit organization**. Release it, open source it, transfer it to a non profit organization or it is prior art that cannot be patented.  It's very anti Bitcoin.

How can you innovate and creates businesses fearlessly when you feel Blockstream's breath behind your neck.

-

I don't know if it was a wise strategy to make (Twitter) propaganda and politics in Bitcoinland. To free-ride and cash in ? Secondly, it raises the question if you are used as a proxy or tool to push the SegWit agenda. You didn't mind probably. It seems you are forcing something onto free and independent actors, which is always a bad thing and people react allergic to it, especially to social media fueled threats.

-

SegWit is technology wise somewhat ok and should be done as a clean HF, but ultimately, it strengthens  the control and dependence on one development team, limiting choice and innovation.  Lastly, it limits the interests and say of miners in the long run, having the risk being disintermediated as soon the bulk of transactions moves offchain and potentially drying up onchain businesses with new changes, where miners cannot vote againts it. Why do we need miners?

-

Miners blocking progress? An attack? Don't be silly, miners asked for (moderate) progress many years ago. Think again who refused progress. Again, free-riding on Bitcoin (Core) has also its disadvantages.  Regarding LTC price , unfortunatley, speculators play with your hopes.

>Bitmain has tested ASICBOOST on the Testnet but has **never used ASICBOOST on the mainnet as implied in Gregory Maxwell’s proposal**. 

-

>We suggest working with the patent owners so that the patent could be used by the public. If all mining equipment could use ASICBOOST, it will lower the J/GH cost and the total network hash rate will increase, making the Bitcoin network even stronger. So, the ASICBOOST method is not a “covert attack” on the Bitcoin PoW function. It is an engineering optimization.

-

>**The Bitcoin community suffered a grave misfortune when Maxwell lead the coup against Gavin Andresen and removed his Github commit access**. It is now incumbent upon us as a community to figure out how to find **a new core developer group that does not busy itself with attacking** one of Bitcoin’s largest investors (Ver), one of its largest exchanges (Coinbase), and its largest mining equipment provider (Bitmain).

-

>There is a history of character assassinations against those who have spoken against SegWit or Core’s roadmap. Gregory Maxwell’s latest round of attempts follow his previous patterns. Maxwell has previously attacked one of most important Bitcoin maintainers Gavin Andresen, one of the earliest public Bitcoin advocates and investors Roger Ver, founder and CEO of one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges Brian Armstrong, the first author of Lightning Network Joseph Poon, and now Bitmain’s co-CEO Jihan Wu.

And in the other tweet

>Lightning therefore introduces borrowing:   To stake a bidirectional payment channel, a hub loans X funds to channel Y for Z time.

Or in other words: Core + SegWit + LN = New Banks

>It is incredibly sad to see how a community founded on ideals of liberty and censorship resistance has fallen victim, en masse, to such obvious social engineering. Many prominent figures in the Bitcoin industry continue to deny that there is censorship on /r/Bitcoin (and by extension bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org), or defend it as necessary moderation. 

-

>Individuals such as **Andreas Antonopolous**, **Adam Back** **and** **Gregory Maxwell**, all of whom have been vocal proponents of the freedom that Bitcoin offers, **have been conspicuously silent** in their failure to condemn this censorship on a grand scale.

I am wondering about Andreas. He was quite careful not to favor any camp. But recently, his comments and writing a [blog](https://segwit.org/segregated-witness-and-aligning-economic-incentives-with-resource-costs-7d987b135c00#.2mvkqaln3) for Blockstream's SegWit portal questions his objectivity or not being biased.

-

>When asked if he has ever communicated with any of the Bitcoin Core contributors, Bhardwaj first responded that the ideas of Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Core need to be merged to produce the best possible version of Bitcoin. When pushed further, Bhardwaj responded, “No, we [have] not connected to any Bitcoin Core Developer yet.”

>According to one Bitcoin Core contributor, multiple attempts have been made at opening a dialogue with GBMiners.

Kyle, I guess they have their reasons. And you showcase your biased writing again that favors Core. Why don't you ask BU developers as well? 


Footage from [BS HQ](https://youtu.be/c6bEs3dxjPg?t=3m32s). Time for Adam to book some flight tickets "again". /u/ViaBTC: be ready to receive collaboration orders. Beware of Samsung's sushi invites and "Coreanish" translations.
>Last February some of the mining community and some of the developer community got together **to discuss potential hard-forks**, with the aim of coming up with a reasonable proposal to take to the wider community for further discussion and consensus building. Let’s look at where that effort has lead.

Peter, it was an agreement and not a discussion. Your name and the names of other "honourable" members of Core are on the [agreement](https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff)! 

-

Why would someone "discuss" late into the night behind closed doors. It looks like you trying to twist the words and deliberately changing the HK roundtable narrative. You are basically saying that Jihan Wu, Wang Chun and Wu Gang all got it wrong.
 
-

[Jihan](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/antpool-will-not-run-segwit-without-block-size-increase-hard-fork-1464028753) made it very clear: he and his buddies **will not run SegWit without block size increase**. No SegWit, no LN and no Sidechains.

-

Why is it for Core so hard to give choice. To the miners, you have not obligations to stick with Core. You are free to test Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited and see how it goes. 

Greg and Luke stated few weeks ago that there will be **no 2 MB HF** (i.e., non-witness data).

The Core way
> Something that appears unique to North Queensland is the pioneering of underwriting. These are agreements between BCH investors and merchants whereby the underwriter agrees to purchase the BCH from the merchant honouring the exchange rate at time of sale. This step can occur at the end of the day, week or month as per the agreement.

-

> **The underwriters can purchase BCH without exchange fees making investing in this manner rather attractive and merchants commute BCH sales to cash sales avoiding the large bank fees**. It is a **win-win model** where only the banks and exchanges lose. The model is very successful to allow merchants time to become familiar with the BCH electronic cash system or to hedge against volatility or the like.

I wouldn't say that. 

We have Bcoin, BU, Parity, Bitcoin Classic and Jeff is working on the New York agreement client (what's the name of the client btw?). We have more choice. 

As Bitcoin.com mentioned;

>Our acceptance of this agreement **does not change our support for Bitcoin Unlimited or other implementations**, and we will continue to push for the removal of all centrally-imposed capacity limits on Bitcoin. Any such limit will only ever serve to hinder Bitcoin’s future growth.

 The Big Block movement goes on.
He went full Samsung as well for some time. You missed nothing. 
-

That should be a wake up call. Blocksize increase discussions are going to be banned like Classic and BU. 

-

Control major communication channels and control the narrative what bitcoin is and what an altcoin is. From the handbook of totalitarian regimes. Blockstream and Core support this tacitly, and these guys work on decentralized systems. That should make you think!

-
 
What's next? Onchain transactions aren't Bitcoin transactions as they are controlled by evil miners? IMO, Bitcoin is in danger.
I see. 

From my view, the issue with Theymos and his helpers is that they don't do their task properly: **moderating** civilized discussions. Instead, we see excessive **curation** of  discussions done by very few people.

In my view, curation is done by the community by voting content up or down. That also applies to topics on alternative Bitcoin clients as well.

What was interesting about Brian Kelly today is that he doesn’t really care about Bitcoin Core (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH). He wants “to trade”. Which implicitly suggests that he treats BTC & BCH at the same level & quality.

Now think which one has more up-movement potential.
Cannot be changed ... Why don't you create a new post here on r/btc and offer an AMA (Ask Me Anything)
Then you have useful tools like Tone et al ... who outsourced their opinions... who accept everything from the Core priests... while not using BTC at all. These guys give two f**ks about payments, decentralization and being able to transact your own wealth. 

And folks like Andreas, who are great contributors to spread the Bitcoin message, remain silent in the light of blatant censorship. You should check Andreas' talks 3-4 years ago and now: U-turn.

My approach: downvote and move on. Why waste time. 
Your comment is still visible and more importantly, It is **not removed**. r/BTC make use of reddits voting system, whereas the mods at r/bitcoin interfere heavily be deleting comments that does not fit their narrative. You have to accept it that some people aren't convinced with your comment. 
Don't overrule or reject large parts of the community. Bitcoin is not just for your investors there. You are admitting that you push SegWit/LN at all cost for your business model.

Secondly, Bitcoin is a shared public good, you and your agents cannot claim ownership and change it just for your business model needs. That's egoistic, instead work together with the community!

EDIT: 

Surprisingly, this post gets downvoted.
They would compete with on-chain services (e.g., colored coin services)

-

On-chain is a public good where every company or end-user has access to a secure backbone to move digital assets. 

-

Blockstream has no interest to increase on-chain accessibility and usefulness for their private business gain: sidechains.

-

Tone is so painful to listen with his Core minion syndrome, having not the mental capacity to think beyond Core.  
-

The irony is that small blockers argue they want to protect bitcoin's decentralization, so everyone in the third world can run a node. But with a 1MB block size, the same people in the third world get priced out.  It is too expensive to make a simple transaction. But Core aides like Henry et al. say "but lightning will save us and we can onboard the entire world".  

-

But guess what, we introduce new intermediaries (LN hubs) and Bitcoin's decentralization is at risk!

-

Logical thinking is a scarce skill these days, or they are deliberately  dishonest to follow their own agenda.

and surprise surprise, Blockchain capital invested in BTCC as well, which mines SegWit.

P2P electronic cash system + Digital Gold. 

if you look back, Bitcoin was first an electronic cash system. Being an  electronic cash system **first** made bitcoin valuable in the first place.

But Bitcoin as a P2P electronic cash system is at risk now. 
Entertaining, sad and true 

>**Multisig**: This was supposed to fix all security issues. Except no living being can figure out how to use it and the user experience is super shitty, so it was relegated to use by professionals who work at exchanges and know what they are doing. Just kidding, Bitfinex! No one even pretends that multisig adds any security any more.

-

>**Sidechains**: This was quite the hot item when it was announced. So hot that it killed off altcoins. But the "trustless reverse peg" turned out to be a bunch of handwavy bullshit and never materialized. If you want to experiment with a trustless altcoin today, you cannot use sidechains, and that was the whole point of sidechains.

-

>**Smart Contracts**: "Money is only the first application," they used to say. But it turned out that it was also the last app. Smart contracts had to be developed by Ethereum, which took over what butters see as their own territory, namely, hype. Butters now end up constantly shitposting about ETH because they are bitter about their inability to claim this new area.

-

>**Segwit SF**: The main point was to increase the blocksize. Ooops, no, it was to fix transaction malleability. Oops, no, it was to create a fee market to prepare us for the coming coin apocalypse in 2041, because butters can never be too prepared. Even the Chinese miners, who go along with just about anything, got pissed off at this shitshow, and now, it will not activate.

-

>**Lightning Network**: This doesn't work unless Segwit is activated, so it's dead now. Without Segwit, I can steal cash out of the channel, so this dumb idea isn't going anywhere.

-

>**Off-chain scaling**: No one knows what the big peer-to-peer credit network between incorrigible gamblers and casinos as well as addicts and their dealers looks like. But that doesn't stop the butters from claiming that they can compete with SWIFT with this non-existent network. Wanna send money to the west coast? I'll just send it to my dealer Big D, who has a credit relationship with a diseased whore who has a john, who knows a guy ... This is supposed to be the future.

-

>**LN Routing**: Speaking of which, routing for the Lightning Network doesn't exist. The only topology that is efficient to route over is a single hub-and-spoke, with a bank at the center, and some deluded butters are lining up to actually make this happen, the same deluded people who oppose big blocks because mah-de-centralization. Also, routing leaks information, like how much credit you have with your dealer Big D, and how much of it you used this week.

-

>**Confidential Transactions**: Confidential what? Even the IRS knows how to trace Bitcoin transactions now, and ZCash completely cut into Bitcoin's main selling point. Anyone remember how they used to say "Bitcoin is anonymous?" Then it was "Bitcoin is pseudonymous?" Well, what is it after your exchange turns over all your info to the Feds?

-

>**Teechan**: This was announced with a whitepaper but without a prototype, which is an improvement over the usual butter way of announcing bullshit on an irc/slack channel, but in any case, my bet is that these guys don't have any code. In the fine tradition of Craig Wright, when it comes time to unveil the code "in a few weeks," there'll be a huge no show and following public embarrassment.

**UASF is an altcoin** as it does not follow the rules outlined in Bitcoin white paper (PoW). 

I suggested to the UASF folks to write their own white paper that reflects their consensus mechanism: the number of non-mining nodes. 

I can understand they want to freeride on the Bitcoin name or use it as leverage against non-Segwit miners (who are the majority btw). But again, UASF is not bitcoin, it can branded as "bitcoin inspired" altcoin like the other hundreds of altcoins.

😭 Waaaaaaaa they don’t call it Bcash ... Waaaaaaa 😭😭😭
**Bitcoin Cash folks don't preach the "store of value" fairytale story.**

Matter of fact, Bitcoin Core is doing a lousy job in everything,and folks realizing it by selling it. Outlook looks bleak, also after 18 months.

And since it has the most trading pairs for now, it drags the whole market down. Bitcoin Core has to be replaced!
because he doesn't believe in his words or hasty damage control? 
>Bitcoin Cash Will Overtake Bitcoin Soon

**Dan didn't say that ....**  He said  BCH is cheaper, faster and has more room to grow than BTC... which is correct. 
We take them all... whether organic or artificial... they paid 1 sat and BCH works 😎

It seems /u/Craig_S_Wright and /u/ThomasZander should meet up for 🍺 sometime. If possible, livestream it on YouTube. That would be highly interesting!
Take note who is attacking.

Paid.

Some of them have very few followers and retweet random things or Core friendly messages. For instance, F2Pool prior tweet rejecting hardfork was highly shared. I have doubts there are real and twitter accounts can be easily bought.
It's always hard to lose your first tooth. But you get used to it.

I dunno who owns shapeshift and if it has investors. But if yes,  he is going to justify why he is burning (investor) money with Bitcoin Core client and did everything he could in the light of alternatives such as BU. Time and money will show.

So "some" Core developers and Blockstream president/individual completely wasted the time of all roundtable attendees. The same Blockstream individual now wants to "collaborate" (still) to have SegWit asap. Wonderful!

It's time to shift the focus from "Why Does Core Not Increase the Block Size" to **"Miners, What Are You Waiting For?**

It seems they have a narrow thinking. Bitcoin itself is not evil. 
> Bitcoin becoming less useful for payments, however. Transaction confirmation times have risen substantially; this, in turn, has led to an increase in the failure rate of transactions denominated in fiat currencies. (By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it’s for the “wrong” amount.) Furthermore, fees have risen a great deal. For a regular **Bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of U.S. dollars is common, making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires.**

It looks like that the market is increasingly frustrated with large miners like /u/jihan_bitmain, /u/macbook-air or HaoBTC, who are undecided, stagnating the commercial use of Bitcoin, and ultimately harming the whole community. 

I'm still surprised why Bitcoin payment processors like [BitPay](https://twitter.com/spair/status/757908557949984769) don't make an outcry, as they are the first ones that suffer from this market choking. 
Why can't you guys use streaming options (e.g., youtube) like everyone else on this planet? Why do I have to register or use Cisco plugins?

The most and still disturbing story about blockstream is that a **single company** uses VC money (if true) to influence the Bitcoin protocol in a way that gives priority to their corporate interest.

Most of the things are open source (maybe not anymore in the future). Sidechains are  useful, no doubt. But it is blatantly clear that they pursuit self interest before the community. 

Adam, please fix your Twitter bio btw. It is dishonest to imply that you invented Bitcoin.
I may add: live-streaming the event and the doors are locked until consensus is reached.

Sorry, but 15 months sounds very very fishy. 

Look, the blocks get full and bitcoin loses its original mission:*A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*. People try to change the narrative that bitcoin becomes a settlement network for large sums. Which is not. Bitcoin must maintain its accessibility and affordability.

It gives the impression that they deliberately slow down the process to push their project and make VCs happy. Venture capitalist aren't charity organizations. I would like to see a public Gantt chart for transparency reasons. 

Anyways, Classic should keep moving forward.

>The costs are effectively externalized to users. I, hence, don't like calling the costs "trivial". I don't like making this decision for others, I'm not convinced that they are trivial for everyone. Besides, this will increase supply of block chain space, and thus push down transaction fees, but at cost to *all users*, even users that hardly do any transactions. Hence it favors those that generate lots of transactions (is that a perverse incentive? not sure, but it needs to be weighted in any decision).

>A mounting fee pressure, resulting in a true fee market where transactions compete to get into blocks, results in urgency to develop decentralized off-chain solutions. I'm afraid increasing the block size will kick this can down the road and let people (and the large Bitcoin companies) relax, until it's again time for a block chain increase, and then they'll rally Gavin again, never resulting in a smart, sustainable solution but eternal awkward discussions like this.

>Investment in off-chain solutions is guided by not only fee pressure, but also other reasons such as speed of confirmation, which is unreliable on-chain. This eases objection

http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-May/007890.html

1) I am not sure if that is aligned with miners interest to push transactions off chain. 

2) the more transactions are happening on-chain, the more valuable Bitcoin becomes for everyone. 

3) Creating a (too early) fee market with the intention to push for off-chain solutions could endanger Satoshi's vision of a pure [*A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

Criticizing Bitcoin Core is blasphemy according to Core priests and their disciples ... 
Reality is that developers "propose" rules (BCH implementations such as BU, ABC, parity, BCHD implementations) and miners adopt or reject them.  

Both groups are nudged/pushed by other stakeholders (businesses, end-users etc).

Coindesk is a **biased infomercial and conference outlet** to nurture Barry's portfolio companies (Digital Currency Group). There was initially no coverage about BCH (like BitPay BCH news), or extreme biased coverage towards BCH.

someone is trying to manipulate the market.
Just wait when F2Pool, Bitfury and Slush strategically wait and stop their signaling.  It’s like in a battlefield, Core minions on Reddit/twitter is the first wave of many the closer NYA gets! 
Litecoin wants to be the cash layer of Bitcoin Core. With Bitcoin Cash's successful launch, Litecoin feels now redundant, neglected and betrayed. Not sure if Twitter polls make the difference 🤔

 #SadStory, but life goes on. 
I think you have to be 1) handsome and 2) choose the appropriate Twitter rule violation. Evidently, Bcash acted maliciously by impersonating a group/movement to mislead users. 
Disinformation about Bitcoin Cash.
Doesn't work with Blockstream's business model: it needs full blocks

Before people blindly adopt SegWit,they should check the **patent implications**. Very thoroughly!

Segwit might be open source, but the systems on top of SegWit might be subject to patents.

/u/luke-jr Why don't you accept the possibility that the majority does not share your view. Secondly, can you clarify "fight"? Does it include "any" efforts to sabotage BU (and BU supporting entities)  from a technical and/or communication viewpoint?


Wow... just wow!!
It depends what's favorable for him and blockstream. We accept miners' choice, meanwhile we do everthing we can to kick them out. 

-

Next, we invent new voting mechanisms based on node numbers.  
-

At the end, developers propose software. Miners choose software that makes (business) sense and promises the greatest value.

Core and its Twitter/reddit aides just do fearmongering that BU is developed by amateurs. AFAIK, 99% of BU code is Core code.

**Really?** To me it behaves more as casino chips for Wallstreet and hobby gamblers on centralized exchanges ? Where do you see the P2P cash usage part? 

EDIT: Okay, dude has deleted his/her comment. Paraphrasing it: That BTC is gold and BCH medium of exchange. In other words, BCH cannot be gold.

Bitcoin BCH has the same properties and performs better:

-

- BCH shares the same Bitcoin genesis block, 
- BCH will have 21 million coins as well
- BCH has way more room for innovation -> happening!
- and BCH works way better as cash than Bitcoin Core (BTC) does -> happening!

I don't see the issue. As F2Pool stated, Classic is compatible with Core (until 75%). F2Pool honors still its agreement with Block$tream.
I think all core developers **have to meet** in person and no one leaves the room until an agreement is reached.
I think you have to explain to the newbies here that (1) the coins they hold aren't impacted, (2) the blocks contain more transactions and that (3) block rewards stay the same?

I don't think so. **I see BCH leading in everything**:

- having colored coins, we can extend BCH's functionalities beyond open payments 
- There are proposals to increase BCH's privacy 
- Lastly, BCH has huge support among different stakeholders (miners, businesses, exchanges wallet providers, developers etc)

**Overall, BCH is doing very well!**

The **silent majority** will make their own research if they are interested and open minded. Who is Roger and what is Bitcoin Cash. 
**The new controlled narrative is "Store of Value Coin".**

But they know that they are BS-ing themselves. How? They started to push the LN vaporware story again, again and again, which is about to be ready soonish...  since 2015. And no words about the negative LN side effects: centralizing bitcoin even more.  

 The high BTC price is actually a blessing in two ways: 

-

- it brings more capital into crypto, which can be converted into other coins -> Bitcoin Cash 
- it is opening the eyes of everyone, how f**ed up legacy bitcoin has become with its high fees.

-

PS: Scaling through liecoin is fading, but they will push it again slowly. First, sharing a Charlie tweet that is bashing BCH in some ways (Hey look Charlie is on our side), and then sell liecoin as a scaling solution for Bitcoin again. #facepalm.

**Choked off by Core and Blockstream.**

Take colored coins as an example . It was truly innovative and was supporting Bitcoin, but with Core's 1 MB block obstruction it has been deliberately killed as it would compete with sidechains.
True story folks! 
>Without full blocks that means there isn't a backlog of fee paying transactions, so as the subsidy continues its geometric fall there won't be a strong incentive to move the chain forward-

I mean ... really ? Since when is he concerned about miners?
Why is Adam lying? Why does nobody from Core condemn this. Where is Bruce Fenton our ultimate saviour and opinion leader when we need him?

-

> Should have been first priority

[This happened](http://www.coindesk.com/blockstream-21-million-seed-capital/) as (business) priorities shifted towards 2nd layer systems while blocking any meaningful onchain scaling proposals as "too risky" and there is "no consensus". How convenient!

-

And how we achieve consensus is deliberately kept vague and flexible. Well, this could be contentious as well. Everything is contentious. But we all agree on Sidechain and  SegWit. How convenient!

-

VCs aren't charity organizations and after 2-3 years with no real revenues, VCs want to see a ROI. Our supreme CSO and crypto hatter shall convince them all that Sidechain is the holy grail of blockchains, made by Blockstream of course. How convenient!

-

I don't think it is a fair comparison. Bitcoin Unlimited is largely based on Core with some tweaks to accommodate Core's shortcomings. Not sure if that requires continuous and large changes. Someone would get the impression that graph is used to deliberately discredit BU as an inferior Bitcoin client. 

-

-

I think the BU community needs to think about measures in the event of a HF (which is a potential case now):

-

- What can we learn from Polinex and Coinbase regarding ETC/ETH?

-

- I expect Blockstream, BTCC,  Bitfury and their VC network to initiate efforts to undermine Bitcoin that is based on BU. What are the appropriate and civilized counter measures?

-

- It would be good to create mutual understanding among exchanges, wallet providers etc to speak one language. What is true Bitcoin? Bitcoin that has the most work?

-

Imo, it would be desirable to have only **one bitcoin**. Not Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin BU. These are merely clients that change the features of the one and only **Bitcoin Blockchain**.

-

Is it normal that you release a new version with no explanations what have been added/changed? 
-

I would say these numbers are very inconvenient for them as this would question the usefulness, authority and validity of Bitcoin Core Client software and their associates. That's why discussions about alternative clients aren't allowed. "They are altcoins" is well fabricated BS. 

-

They play with fire: they intentionally created this network bottleneck to promote Core+SegWit as **the cure** for all our pains. But free miners didn't follow mindlessly. These rising fees could back fire, forcing them to compromise, which they cannot (yet). 

-

Meanwhile we have a new ATL (All-Time-Low) for [Bitcoin Core blocks](https://coin.dance/blocks/historical) 813. Everything is fine.

>Roger Ver, shilling for his altcoin investments... just a typical day.

From my view, Roger is still committed towards Bitcoin. He spends substantial amount of time and resources to keep the original vision of Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System by bitcoin creator aka Satoshi Nakamoto. 

What you guys are doing is potentially reintroducing intermediaries, putting miners out of business, which are the (difficult) guardians of Bitcoin. Without miners, we have developers left, who could abuse their influence. 
⛄️
Well said! Small blockers don't get it for some reasons. 
-

They should launch/release it to the public then we can talk. **So far it is hot air and an ivory tower project on testnet to keep people silent**. 

-

Secondly, I don't like the fact that a  decentralized, existing and working solution (onchain) gets stifled/choked to promote vaporware that is likely centralized (offchain). 

-

Core/Blockstream concentrate all their efforts to make Bitcoin ready for offchain and develop questionable patches like RBF to avoid total system blockage.

-

Bitcoin is at risk to become centralized while it gets pushed towards offchain. **Wake up r/bitcoin**!

The bottom line is that Bitcoin doesn't work properly as it should. Bitcoin has not the optimal **user experience**. I don't know if you take user experiences and their needs into considerations while making technical sound justifications.

Henry, most r/btc guys don't rule out offchain solutions. We embrace it.

-

It is politics and commercial interest of very few individuals at sensitive control points (development and information channels), who cause immense harm and stagnation to the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin's current value rests on speculation and speculations are driven by expectations. From my view, people started to resign slowly (BU is the only hope now and Core members know that by attacking the BU team continuously).

-

They (Core and their agents) purposefully delay scaling of straightforward solutions for the sake of imaginary [**vaporware solutions**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware). Are we talking about 2 years scaling efforts?

-

I am asking you, do your customers don't complain about delayed transactions and hence increasing the number of service tickets, causing costs for you? Is that fun?

-

Bitcoin shouldn't rest on its first mover advantage. 
So what is the situation after the San Francisco relationship counceling?

-

**One month has passed without any news, no nothing**. /u/Jihan_bitmain is talking less lately as like he received a gag order by Core, supporters, agents and other minions.

How can the largest miner with so much to lose ignore these crystal clear  signals from the market.

It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion while Samsung is applauding and waving Blockstream banners. Greg clearly stated that his for profit company is not interested to advance onchain transactions. 
The fear of adoption  🤔
So they say in other words: Everyone should be equal and no one should have an competitive advantage. Sounds like communistic thinking. 

The protocol is defining what the minimum standards are and if someone is doing it better and cheaper, why not? Others are welcome to innovate as well. Why slow or deter innovation?

Disturbing to see that a select group consisting of opinion leaders and followers are conducting central planning while leveraging on their incumbent position to force a change for the whole Bitcoin ecosystem. 

EDIT: More disturbing to see that they threaten 21 Inc's business model. 21 is doing so much for the community, why this rival thinking? 
We should not demonize technology. Yes, all proposals are good to bring Bitcoin forward. We have just different views on the timing and priority.

It's fair to say that any technology has to be reliable first (boring part). Then you add features (exciting part).

Reminds me of [War of Currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Currents) in "circulating assumptions"

>In February 1888 Edison Electric president Edward Johnson published an 84-page pamphlet titled "A Warning from the Edison Electric Light Company" and sent it to newspapers and to companies that had purchased or were planning to purchase electrical equipment from Edison competitors, including Westinghouse and Thomson Houston, stating that the competitors were infringing on Edison's incandescent light and other electrical patents.[46] It warned that purchasers could find themselves on the losing side of a court case if those patents were upheld. The pamphlet also emphasized the safety and efficiency of direct current, with the claim DC had not caused a single death, and included newspaper stories of accidental electrocutions caused by alternating current.
Another candidate for the wall of shame.
Sounds like a normal day in Bitcoin land.

People should of course differentiate between person reputation and the technology. **He is not Mr Bitcoin Cash!** We have 5 other developer teams. You don’t have to like him, everyone should have their opinion. Yes, he failed to prove that he is Satoshi for whatsoever reasons. 

But he helps the cause, but we shouldn’t be blind as well if we see bad things **at a technical or patent  level**! 
The smart money has already moved into Bitcoin Cash. Those who truly understand how bitcoin works ... recognize Bitcoin Cash’s value!

and that has to happen **now** in the year of 2017? You are probably aware when the block reward dries up, are you?
Yes ... rebels against censorship, rebels against strategic growth choking and especially rebels against one client to rule them all.
It isn't about SegWit, they want Segwit **delivered by Core** that is the real story. 

If you a jerk the last 3 years to the entire Bitcoin community, people don't want to deal with kids anymore.
It's precise! 
The technical and economic community is doing everthing they can to save Bitcoin as P2P electronic cash systems. 

We have separatists here who want to transform Bitcoin to a UASF coin with low hashrate and fakeable node numbers. To my knowledge, their hashrate is based on laptops. 

That's the real story 
-

Dude, if development were truly decentralized, censorship free and not orchestrated in a way to delay block size increases, we would have something to celebrate.

 Right now Bitcoin development is centralized  and dictated by a small group of people, firms and developers who don't think big, who think about their companies and VCs first. Not users . 

 Check this, all technical communication channels are controlled by Blockstream people and affiliates .

**Roger, it doesn't matter if it is true or false. It helps to harm your reputation and the reputation of other Bitcoin clients**

Core minions and biased journalists will pick it up and share it on controlled communication channels and the truth will be drowned. You will be portrayed as someone who wants to destroy Core or Bitcoin with your wealth again and again.

-

**Don't you see the source of all these attacks?** All the attacks and vilifying come from one place: Blockstream and from the CEO personally, which will be amplified by trolls. 

-

An no moderate Core member or supporter will correct or condemn this, because of financial interests or the fear that the dragon den members will unleash their troll army on them.

> Are you seriously ok with **a company being against protocol upgrades**, just because it forces them to compete in the marketplace?

Are you talking about Blockstream? 
The real good news is that people invest in larger blocks.
>I’m completely puzzled by the current direction of development in Bitcoin Core. Their plan is to cap on chain transactions (as mentioned the very selling feature of Bitcoin) in favour for off chain transactions. This is before we have even tried to scale on chain and before Bitcoin has hit any form of adoption curve. 

-

>Off chain transactions are exactly what the existing banking infrastructure does today. Many state that they don’t want Bitcoin to become a payment processor like paypal or visa, yet ironically by stopping on chain transactions and by opting first for off chain is exactly what they are doing to Bitcoin. The Blockchain is Bitcoins true innovation and attraction, instead we are leaving it to stagnate.

-

>Again if the Blockchain can go to to 4MB or 8MB then thats 4x — 8x growth. That’s more users, more venture capital, more businesses all discovering Bitcoin, driving the price up, creating more buzz, creating faster innovation and further improving the scaling of the network. 

-

>Once we hit a block limit as dictated by current hardware capacity then we can use transactions fees to limit transactions and think about off chain transactions. Then we continue to innovate to fit more on chain.

-

> To me its almost like people are working on ways to make Bitcoin more complicated and in the long run make it more unpopular.

-

>Where is the mathematical proof for an optimum value? The block size should not be some hard coded arbitrary value it should be given to the miners in order to determine what the optimum value is they can tolerate and still be profitable.

-

>There have been a number of theories and even conspiracy theories linked to the Bitcoin company Blockstream where a number of its developers are involved in Bitcoin core. All I will say is there is quite clearly a conflict of interest. Blockstream have received millions of dollars in investment where their business model is to make money from off chain transactions. This is quite clearly a conflict of interest and have avoided scaling on chain. 

-

>**It’s odd that many early adopters of Bitcoin ignore this conflict and quite readily submit to their authority**. These are the same people who bemoan the Federal Reserve or other privileged financial institutions yet can not see the contradiction in their current views towards **Bitcoin Core, who have become the Federal Reserve in Crypto Currencies**.

So what?

It was because of Adam's individual, president, dipshit title confusion and fiasco. The miners (/u/jihan_bitmain, /u/macbook-air) believed Adam would speak for Core, which was not the case, and I am pretty sure they used this ambiguity to lure miners to an agreement. **"Look we have the president of Blockstream here, they hired most Core developers. Trust us!"**

-

Miners were rightly pissed off **after** it became clear that Adam has no say and they felt betrayed. But hey, the miners returned back, because of Samsung translations. 

-

And what did they get? Nothing, besides funny tweets mocking miners who did not upgraded to SegWit. To the miners here who did not upgraded to SegWit : Why wait? Why?

HaoBTC, you don't have to ask for permission, mine what is right for you. 
>“I think there is a lot of understandable feelings of not wanting to contribute to Bitcoin Core and protocol-level development because 'nothing in Bitcoin is new again.’ When you come into Bitcoin as a developer, **you're gonna first suggest the same 100 changes everyone else did the first year.** **And it doesn't usually feel great to be constantly told your ideas are not useful** — especially when you're communicating over text, and you don’t see that people are trying to help. You just see a bunch of people who keep telling you you're wrong.”

I believe BTCC and BitFury belong to the same syndicate. They share some of their VCs. It would be interesting to map all the VC connections and who demands/supports SegWit. There might be an overlap. 

I think Bitfury (miner), BTCC (miner/exchange) and Blockstream (developers) are used as proxies to influence the Bitcoin protocol. 
It is a sleazy and sneaky way to rob voting rights and lure people into something they don't "actively" decide on.

-

We don't need leaders, we need rational thinking Bitcoin actors.

-

 Why on earth should miners give in and support SegWit in its current form that opens the gates for dynamic and high growth off chain solutions, while onchain is deliberately choked at 1 MB. Why? **Miners should have a say about dynamic market driven blocks** and not beg developers (who give two f***s what happens onchain).

-

There is no guarantee by offchain developers  (Blockstream, Core et al.) to increase onchain blocksize, because they **could dry up miners** by keeping the transactions offchain through a PoW change. Miners would risk to lose everything. 

-


Well, everyone is free to run ads and it's good business for reddit.

>Is Bitcoin a currency or a commodity? In my view, this is a bit like the relationship between water and a boat. If bitcoin does not have widespread acceptance as a currency, then its value as a commodity is an illusion. **Limiting Bitcoin’s capacity is therefore a ridiculous strategy**. It’s as if Facebook would have continued to only let users with a .edu email address register. If they had done that, there wouldn’t be a Facebook today.

Some questions by  Aaron van Wirdum are bit strange. He is concerned about shrinking node numbers/centralization  and then this comment packed as question:

>Many use cases can also be realized through added layers. Some of these layers already exist, like ChangeTip or Coinbase’s off-chain transactions. And trustless layers like the lightning network are in production as well.

So Aaron,  offchain is truly decentralized? 

-

EDIT: passive aggressive questions saying ViaBTC makes a mistake.  

-

EDIT 2: Aaron, a Core minion in sheep's clothing.

>Bitcoin should be defined by a standard protocol instead of mere codes.

Can you elaborate on it?
ACK
-

**The FUD starts, again**

-

If mining is profitable, which is apparently, it will attract new players. I am puzzled that these people have no clue about competition and market dynamics. This is also what [Satoshi](https://twitter.com/drwasho/status/792595422376144897) has predicted.

-

It's easy for slush to say this as they largely mediate hash power. I'm not aware that they have their own mining farm.

-

The barrier to enter the mining market is relatively low. You need money, cheap electricity and ASiC chips.

-


I wouldn't be surprised if Core/Blockstream planned measures to reduce the power of miners. 

-



BTCC: loyal Core and Blockstream agent and belonging to the Digital Currency Group Empire. You help your buddies. 
In what kind of bubble does he live?
-

We should probably stop blaming Core and direct the attention to miners. There is a solid alternative called BU. 

-

Miners have a choice! **Now it's more politics than technical excuses**. u/ViaBTC made the step, /u/jihan_bitmain and /u/MacBook-air have to make their steps, if they want change. 

-

I am aware that these guys are late followers, BU needs more midsize/smaller miners. You cannot count on BTCC and BitFury Core agents. 

-

If BU gains traction, developers will join. 

-


-

**My goodness** 

-

I wasn't aware that paranoia and fear was so severe among them and that their subscribers had to be protected. Basically saying we think for you.

-


Does any Core developer protest about the censoring?
-

**Any news regarding the LN routing issue that ensures Bitcoin's decentrality?**

-

Core and BS people glorify LN as the holy grail for all our scaling problems. Yes, 2nd layer solutions are fine and needed. Most r/BTC people embrace it. But if most transactions happen offchain and there is no **competitive choice**, it pushes Bitcoin into a banking layer. LN is just SWIFT 2.0 

-

They show miners a finger, who invested millions in mining farms. They are the guardians of the Bitcoin to ensure decentralization and counterbalance ivory tower projects and their control. We cannot allow commit rights just by one group, where most vocal developers are hired by Blockstream 

-

We need onchain scaling to ensure bitcoin's decentralized nature and immutability. And we need onchain scaling to have **a choice**,whether we transit through centralized or decentralized means.

We like true stories!  
We old men have so much time during retirement, grilling Core minions keeps me active 😏

It has the **potential to become Bitcoin**. According to the white paper (conclusion section)

>They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. **Any needed rules and incentives** can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

If majority of hash power mines Bitcoin Cash, **it becomes Bitcoin**.  Many exchanges (Coinbase, Gemini, Circle etc ) expressed the same notion (longest chain with the most work etc.)

-

That is how bitcoin works. Rewriting the white paper is not the solution. Adapt or create your own coin. Simple!

-


**Forget Core!**

They failed and derailed Bitcoin regarding scaling, attracting more users/businesses and failed especially in attracting talent. Legacy Bitcoin has now 1MB fanatics, a Toddler and an astroturfing Blockstream CEO who fights for relevance.
Core is basically transforming Bitcoin away from P2P electronic cash to a settlement layer for new intermediaries which act like banks. That's not the idea of Bitcoin: https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf

This may also help you to understand why Core tolerates censorship on r/bitcoin and why r/btc was born.

A true story? 

-

All major developer communication channels are in some way influenced/moderated by Blockstream members and associates. 

Rehashing the story "Blockstream doesn't lead Bitcoin" sounds not credible. Proof: the last idea you guys rejected instantly was [Sergio's](https://btcmanager.com/segwit-2mb-block-size-solution-or-submission-of-bitcoin-to-politics/) 2MB SegWit HF propsoal. 

PS: now we have 400 developers (again). The last time we had minor contributors. 
I assume Blockstream/Core want to avoid future hardforks as it would undermine their control. Core would become replaceable with another client and it would dramatically cause problems to raise VC money.

Having developers working on the protocol is an asset for any company, as it allows to influence changes to their benefit. 
We need more miners who have testicles. True story.

The crazy thing is that these guys are pushing for these services, choking on-chain deliberately , and the technical and economic implications aren't clear at all. Don't get me wrong, payment channels are welcome, but don't force it as the only scaling solution.

Bitcoin **client** competition is always good. You are confusing tokens with clients. Just saying.

I don't think I or we give him a hard time here.

It's just a reminder that incumbents come and go, and that anyone should be open about it. While it happens, it is always good to **repeat** what Bitcoin is and tries to avoid. Just because you don't agree with the **scaling method**, you **don't overthrow fundamental Bitcoin principles**. 

-

Core's scaling solution is **pushing users to new trusted intermediaries. That is not decentralized.**  

-

Unique content, interviews, weekly video/audio summary what happened in Bitcoin Land, Bitcoin startup of the week/month presentation. Furthermore, some simple and useful stats in the header would be useful, like txs per second, price,  fee rate, block capacity.

Yes, if you stay in the Blockstream/Core bubble.

Speculation or fact? 

I only know one concrete bribery incident: Adam aka individual/president bribed miners with free software development, in order not to switch to Classic.

Miners should make a move instead talk .

-

Core is going to work on plan B and preparing the scripts for r/Bitcoin, Coindesk et al. minions that BU mined blocks aren't Bitcoins. 
> I think the r/bitcoin moderation policies are absolutely fantastic.

Like [North Korean State TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOROLyD1d8), everything is fine.
Insightful as always.
It must be an unpleasant feeling for certain groups not knowing who provides hashing power to the Bitcoin.com pool. Closed door agreements don't work here.  
Should be a PSA ad at the other sub. 
Competition is always good. The community gives and takes leadership, is not inherited. 
-

It was more of a [relationship counseling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_counseling) trip. 

-

There were nice words here and there to work on developer and miner relationships, but it didn't solve the issue. A [HF](https://petertodd.org/2016/hardforks-after-the-segwit-blocksize-increase) is somehow, somewhen, maybe in the pipeline. But it's more a temporary peace, the storm will come. Interestingly, Peter did not mention the block size of the HF at all (non-witness), as there was little drama by one developer threatening to leave Core/Bitcoin, if he doesn't get his small block.

-

Core has the centralized approach to decentralize  Bitcoin at all cost. Squeezing out unworthy coffee transactions, or unbanked people in developing countries. Core literally changes Bitcoin from *P2P Electronic Cash System* to a settlement system for 2nd layer solutions. What they promise is the holy grail and still vaporware of LN, which will solve everthing. I haven't heard anything from miners what they think of LN? BTCC/BitFury minions don't count.  

-

On-chain and off-chain are competing solutions at the end. Core/Blockstream are creating a competitive advantage for their off-chain solutions at the cost of on-chain providers by delaying/choking on-chain scaling. There is also a major risk that PoW may change to PoS, as miners do not really control 2nd layer solutions. Core was quite flirtatious with this idea, threatening   miners indirectly. 

-

Miners have to pay their bills. If people lose confidence,  the bitcoin price will decline. [As it does](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitstamp/btcusd). That is where miners will for sure get unpleasant. 

-

I assume everyone is welcome.
what bugs me: 

>Please note that this programme is tailored for **industry participants**, and at this time we have **no mechanism for accepting smaller donations**.

Saying:  we are all participants, but some participants are more equal than others.
What is Core's view on Thin Blocks? My impression is that they were not that receptive to it.
The weather conditions are good today.
